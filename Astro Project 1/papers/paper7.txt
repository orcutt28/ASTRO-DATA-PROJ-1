ABSTRACT
Based on deep high resolution JWST images of AS1063, and after a careful masking of artifacts, extended features in the cluster,
and background galaxies (including known lensed ones), we have identified tens of thousands of unresolved point sources in the
central region of the galaxy cluster. We extended the identification of these point sources up to 1.18 Mpc from the center of the cluster
using data in the second module. Most of these sources are expected to be globular clusters orbiting in the deep potential well of the
cluster, but also the surviving compact cores of satellite galaxies. We study the distribution of the globular clusters and compared it
with the distribution of mass from a lens model derived from the same JWST data. We find a very tight correlation between the two
distributions, but also some differences, including a more concentrated distribution for the globular clusters than for dark matter. We
explored the possibility of using the distribution of globular clusters as a proxy for the lensing mass. We find that a simple smoothing
kernel can transform the discrete distribution of point sources into a continuous two-dimensional distribution that matches well the
lensing convergence. This suggests that globular clusters can be used as tracers of the dark matter distribution in other massive clusters
where gravitational lensing constraints are scarce but globular clusters can be detected more easily, for instance in low redshift galaxy
clusters.

1. Introduction
Data from theJames Webbspace telescope (JWST) allows us to
study galaxy clusters and the background galaxies they magnify
with unprecedented detail. Much attention has been paid to the
latter, where some of the best studied so far galaxies at high red-
shift are found magnified behind powerful gravitational lenses.
This has enabled a wealth of studies on these very young galax-
ies, including also detailed spectroscopy that takes advantage of
the magnification provided by the cluster lenses.
But the new JWST images also reveal a never seen before
(at these redshifts) wealth of unresolved sources in the galaxy
clusters themselves (Lee et al. 2022; Harris & Reina-Campos
2023). Most of these compact sources are believed to be
globular clusters (GC) that are stripped away from their host
galaxies and, thanks to their very compact nature, can survive
the strong tidal forces that ripped apart their host galaxies. Some
of these point sources are also expected to be compact cores
of galaxies surrounding the central super massive black hole
(SMBH) of each galaxy. These very compact cores can survive
close encounters with other galaxies, or with the galaxy cluster
central region. Since self-gravitating systems have negative
specific heats, during an interaction the heat transfer between
the cluster core and the satellite galaxy can result in the satellite
core contracting (gravothermal instability Lynden-Bell & Wood
1968; Lightman & Shapiro 1978; Ernst et al. 2007), which
together with tidal shocks accelerate the core contraction in
the satellite galaxies (Gnedin et al. 1999), making them more
prone to survive strong tidal forces. The surviving satellite cores
⋆jdiego@ifca.unican.esend up being very compact and appear as unresolved sources
in JWST images. For simplicity we refer to the two types of
point-like objects as GCs, but keeping in mind that their nature
and origin can be quite different. Owing to their compactness, it
is very unlikely a GC collides with another galaxy in the cluster
or that two GCs collide with each other, so the interaction with
the surrounding medium is mostly only gravitational. Hence
GCs behave as collisionless particles, pretty much as dark matter
(DM) particles are expected to behave. This expected similarity
in how GCs and DM interact with their surrounding medium
begs the question about the possibility of using GCs as tracers
of the distribution of the invisible DM, that may outperform
the suggested correlation between the intracluster-light and
DM Montes & Trujillo (2019); Manuwal et al. (2025); Yoo
et al. (2025), which has been recently suggested to be a biased
tracer of the DM distribution Butler et al. (2025). Results from
simulations indicate that such tight relationship between GC
and DM should exist (Côté et al. 2003; Harris et al. 2017;
Reina-Campos et al. 2022, 2023), and observations with JWST
start to show this relationship with actual data (Diego et al.
2023, 2024). Very large numbers of GCs have been observed in
nearby galaxy clusters (Peng et al. 2011; Durrell et al. 2014),
each with an estimated number of O(105) GCs.
A correlation between the number of GCs,N gc, and the virial
mass of the host halo,M vir, is well established for a wide range
of halo masses. From the relation of Burkert & Forbes (2020),
Mvir=5×109NgcM⊙,(1)
we expect a massive cluster with massM vir=1015M⊙to host
a staggeringN gc∼2×105GCs within the virial radius. This

number corresponds to a mean projected number density of
≈1 GC per 6×6 kpc2unit area assuming a virial radius of 1.5
Mpc, or in volumetric units this corresponds to one GC per 423
kpc3volume, or a mean distance of 84 kpc between GCs. The
gravitational acceleration that one massive 107M⊙GC imparts
onto another GC at 84 kpc distance is≈105times weaker than
the acceleration from aM vir=1015M⊙cluster at 1.5 Mpc, thus
making the attraction between two GCs, separated by the mean
distance above, negligible compared with the attraction imparted
by the galaxy cluster as a whole. Together with the fact that
GCs are very compact (r<50 pc), close encounters between
GCs are expected to be extremely rare. The rarity of two body
interactions between GCs distinguishes their dynamics from the
well studied stars inside an evolved globular cluster, which tend
to converge to an state of energy equipartition due to two-body
relaxation (King 1962; Spitzer 1969; Meylan & Heggie 1997;
Baumgardt 2017), but see also Trenti & van der Marel (2013)
for an alternative perspective. Due to the low probability of
two-body relaxation and the relatively narrow mass function
of GCs, equipartition is not expected in the system of GCs in
galaxy clusters. Some level of dynamical friction is certainly
expected as the more massive GCs. Specially the galactic cores
remnants hosting a SMBH with masses exceeding 108M⊙, will
be slowed down more than the lighter GCs, but this has not been
studied in detail in galaxy clusters, so the situation is unclear.
The massive galaxy clusters that host GCs are also powerful
gravitational lenses. Through strong lensing it is possible to map
the mass distribution in the inner regions of the lenses (where
strong lensing takes place) and compare it with the distribution
of GCs. Hence, the expected correlation between the distribu-
tion of DM and GCs can be tested in galaxy cluster lenses. For
a galaxy cluster to act as a strong lens, the surface mass den-
sity needs to exceed a critical value that scales inversely propor-
tional with the distance to the cluster. Hence, low redshift clus-
ters (where GCs can be studied best) never become supercritical
and can not produce strong lensing. One needs to go to higher
redshifts (z≳0.2) in order to use strong lensing to map the mass
in cluster cores.
Early studies of GCs in galaxy cluster lenses were carried
out by HST data, on relatively low redshift clusters, such as
Abell 1689 (z=0.183), where a similarity between the profiles of
the total projected lensing mass (mostly DM) and GCs was al-
ready demonstrated (Alamo-Martínez et al. 2013). Similar stud-
ies based on HST are limited due to sensitivity of the telescope to
the infrared (where evolved GCs are brightest) and the scarcity
of low redshift cluster lenses. In aged stellar populations, as
the ones expected in GCs within galaxy clusters, the emission
peaks at 1.6µm in the rest-frame of the GC (Sawicki 2002;
Muzzin et al. 2013), where HST’s ability to detect point sources
is at its worst. Meanwhile, JWST’s larger mirror and sensitiv-
ity in the infrared makes it the ideal telescope to study GCs in
galaxy cluster lenses. The first attempt was already made with
the very first scientific observation of JWST, the galaxy cluster
lens SMACS0723 (Lee et al. 2022; Faisst et al. 2022), quickly
followed by a comparison with its lensing mass (Pascale et al.
2022; Mahler et al. 2023; Diego et al. 2023). Many studies of
GCs with JWST followed Harris & Reina-Campos (2023); Mar-
tis et al. (2024); D’Abrusco et al. (2025); Harris et al. (2025).
Other observatories, such as Euclid, have recently followed the
study of GCs in nearby galaxy clusters, such as Fornax (Saifol-
lahi et al. 2025). While Euclid performs shallower observations,
it has a much larger field of view, which is better suited for
nearby clusters. For instance, at the distance of the Fornax clus-ter, an object appears 9.86 magnitudes brighter than if the same
object is atz=0.35 (ignoring color corrections), thus compen-
sating for the reduced depth. At the redshift of Fornax, no strong
lensing is expected but weak lensing mass maps can be obtained
by Euclid thanks to its very large sky coverage. Studies of nearby
clusters comparing the distribution of GCs and DM (from weak
lensing) can be attempted in the near future.
Among the strong lensing clusters showing an abundance of
GCs in JWST data, AS1063 atz=0.348 (also known as RXC
J2248.7-4431 Guzzo et al. 2009), is a remarkable example given
the depth of JWST data and relatively lower redshift (distance
modulus 41.32). This cluster was selected as one of the clusters
for the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) program (Lotz et al. 2017)
due to its large mass and existence of known gravitationally
lensed galaxies (Postman et al. 2012; Balestra et al. 2013;
Monna et al. 2014; Johnson et al. 2014; Richard et al. 2014;
Zitrin et al. 2015). As part of this program, the central∼10
arcmin2region was observed in wavelengths ranging from 0.45
µm to 1.6µm and to a depth of∼28.5 mag in the visible and IR
bands. The area observed by the HFF program around AS1063
was later doubled thanks to the Beyond Ultra-deep Frontier
Fields and Legacy Observations (BUFFALO) program (Stein-
hardt et al. 2020), although with shallower observations than
in the HFF program. JWST data complements the high-quality
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data extending the wavelength
coverage to≈5µm and similar depths.
The high-quality data provided by the HFF program allowed
the identification of hundreds of multiply lensed galaxies
behind the six clusters HFF clusters. Many of the new lensed
galaxies were spectroscopically confirmed from the ground,
with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE, Bacon
et al. 2010) playing a pivotal role. Improved lens models for this
cluster were derived from the HFF data (Caminha et al. 2016;
Diego et al. 2016; Vega-Ferrero et al. 2019; Chan et al. 2020;
Granata et al. 2022) making this cluster one of the best studied
gravitational lenses.
AS1063 was recently observed by JWST as part of the
GLIMPSE program (Atek et al. 2025), with very long expo-
sures making AS1063 an ideal object for both lensing and GC
studies. GLIMPSE data has been used for a variety of studies
from high redshift galaxies (Kokorev et al. 2025a,b; Korber et al.
2025; Chemerynska et al. 2025), including very low metallicity
ones (or Pop III galaxy candidates Fujimoto et al. 2025), to early
SMBH (Fei et al. 2025). The new JWST data allows for novel
studies that could not be attempted before. Precise lens mod-
els of massive galaxy clusters tracing the projected distribution
of mass (mostly DM), can be compared with the distribution of
GCs detected by JWST. GCs are expected to react to the gravita-
tional potential in a very similar fashion as DM does, assuming
DM is composed of collisionless particles. Using GCs as visible
tracers of DM shall open new avenues to advance on the under-
standing of this mysterious substance.
Based on previous HST data and the new JWST data, a new
lens model was derived in Diego et al. (2026) (or paper-I). In this
work we used this lens model to compare with the distribution of
GCs, which is the main focus of this paper. Here we present the
GCs from the same GLIMPSE data and compare the distribution
of GCs with the lensing mass from paper-I.
The paper is organized as follows. Sect. 2 describes briefly
the JWST data used in this work. In Sect. 3 we focus our at-
tention on the GCs describing the steps followed to derive the
GC catalog. We compare the lens model and GC distribution in

from the distribution of GCs. Section 5 estimates the level of
contamination from background galaxies that is needed in or-
der to correct the one-dimensional density profile. We discuss
the one dimensional profiles in Sect. 6. Finally, Sect. 7 summa-
rizes our conclusions. We adopted a standard flat cosmological
model withΩ M=0.3 andh=0.7. At the redshift of the lens(z=0.348), and for this cosmological model, one arcsecond
corresponds to 4.921 kpc.

AS1063 was observed in 2024 by JWST as part of the Cy-

3293). An overview of the GLIMPSE program and details of
the data are given in Atek et al. (2025). Typical 5σdepth for
a point source (0′′.2 aperture diameter) is 30.9 mag across 9 fil-
ters: F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M,
F444W, F480M totaling 120 hours of exposure time.
This JWST data were reduced in a similar fashion as in the
EPOCHS series of papers (e.g. Conselice et al. 2024; Adams
et al. 2025). We use a modified version of the official JWST
pipeline version 1.8.2, using Calibration Reference Data Sys-
tem (CRDS) pmap1364 to a pixel scale of 0′′.03 pix−1. To better
preserve the light from the foreground cluster and prevent over-
subtraction due to the bright central galaxy we do not include 1/f
subtraction, and we employ a custom 2d background subtraction
between stages 2 and 3 (Goolsby et al. in preparation) . We fur-
ther include the subtraction of custom wisp templates (Adams
et al. 2025), and the images are aligned to GAIA DR3 during
stage 3 (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2023).
3. Globular clusters in AS1063
We used the short wavelength filters, F090W, F115W, F150W,
and F200W, to detect GCs since they have the best spatial
resolution and sensitivity to unresolved sources in JWST. We
applied two steps of high pass filters to remove signal above
some spatial scale and boost the signal-to-noise ratio for point
sources. In particular, we used the standard difference of two
Gaussian smoothed versions of the same image, also known
as À Trous wavelet. This is equivalent to a high pass filter
in Fourier space and very similar to the popular Mexican hat
wavelet. Before applying the filter, we masked bright sources
(by setting a threshold in the filtered images) and artifacts that
otherwise would result in spurious point sources in our final
map. Among the artifacts, we masked bright diffraction features
around stars and other bright sources (such as AGNs). We alsomasked other bright extended galaxies (foreground, member,
and background galaxies) and all known and candidate lensed
galaxies from paper-I, in particular thin giant arcs that, similarly
to the case of the diffraction spikes, would result in spurious
point sources along the arc after the filtering process. These arcs
also contain many unresolved sources that could be confused
with GCs, so they need to be masked. We also masked the cores
of bright member galaxies and large spirals in the cluster, which
can also result in point sources after the filter is applied. Finally,
we masked the edges of the image (rectangular regions of width
≈6”.6), since these have significantly higher noise and result in
more spurious detections.
A small level of contamination is still expected after the
masking, but this should come mostly from compact dwarf
galaxies in the cluster, which nevertheless serve also as tracers
of the potential and often contain GCs as well. Also, compact
dwarf galaxies are much less common than diffuse ones, with the
latter being effectively suppressed by the filtering process. More
importantly, small high-z galaxies are a true contamination to
our sample, but these should have a rather uniform distribution
across the field of view. We discuss the level of contamination in
section 5 where we use the data in the second module to assess
the level of contamination. The final mask in the main module
is shown in the bottom right panel (C) of Fig. 1. After masking,
we built the high-pass filtered image. In the first step, we started
with a filterG 0.5−G 5whereG 0.5is a Gaussian with FWHM=0.5
pixels andG 5is a Gaussian with FWHM=5 pix. The first
scale (0.5 pix) reduces slightly the instrumental noise while the
second scale (5 pix) removes structures larger than 5 pixels.
At this point, the filtered image shows large positive peaks at
the position of luminous sources. If these were not already
included in our mask, we added these regions to the mask and
remove these luminous sources. The resulting image has most
of the large scale structure removed, or masked, but still shows
diffuse emission around bright sources with a large gradient
in the light, specially around the BCG. To reduce this diffuse
emission even further we performed a second high pass filter
similar to the previous one but with scales 1 and 3 pixels, that
is,G 1−G 3. As before,G 1reduces the contribution from noisy
pixels whileG 3removes the unwanted diffuse emission. The fil-
terG 1−G 3sharpens the point sources facilitating their detection.
The final step is to detect the point sources in the filtered
detection map. This map is built after adding the double-filtered
images of F090W, F115W, F150W, and F200W. Equal weights
are assumed for each band, which corresponds to an agnostic
prior on the spectra of the GCs. We started by the brightest pixel,
recorded it, and masked the area around that pixel with a disk of
radius 3 pixels. Then we found the new maximum and repeated
the process until a predetermined threshold was reached. We
defined the threshold as the point where detections start to show
a regular pattern associated with the CCDs, as this is a clear
sign that we are reaching the noise detection level. Even though
we stopped the detection at this point, the final catalog of GCs
contains only objects detected at twice this threshold to reduce
the number of spurious detections, but among the discarded
sources there are definitely more, but faint, GCs.
The detected GCs are shown in Fig. 2 as red dots. A clear
concentration is found around the BCG with the GC distribution
stretching in the same NE direction as the lens model shown in
Fig. 1. A direct comparison of the surface number density of

of 3”×3”. The dashed line corresponds toy=0.4x0.7and fits reasonably
well the observed correlation.
GCs,Σ GCvs the local average of the lens model convergence,
<κ>, reveals a strong correlation, as shown in Fig. 3.
To derive this result, we first computed the surface density of
GCs, n GC, and average convergence,<κ >, in boxes of 3”×3”.
Then we selected areas with similar n GCand computed the mean
and dispersion of< κ >values in the same regions. We find the
scaling law< κ >=0.4n0.7
GCfits well the correlation. From this
simple relation we see that regions in the lens plane with GC
densities n GC>4 arcsec−2should be supercritical (κ >1) and
contain multiply lensed galaxies. The relation seems to break
at very high values of n GCbut this is due to the baryonic con-
tribution to the convergence that increasesκnear the center of
halos while the number density of GCs plateaus at the center of
halos. In the opposite regime where n GCis low, the correlation
seems to hold. This is an important result which can be exploited
to fill the gap of incomplete lens models with few lensing con-
straints in the outskirts of the cluster. The relation between n GC
andκmay be also used in combination with strong lensing, for
instance in two merging clusters, A & B, where one of the clus-
ters is rich, A, in lensing constraints but the other one, B, is not.
The well constrained cluster A can be used to calibrate the n GC–κ
relation which can later be used to infer the mass distribution of
the poorly constrained B cluster, from its system of GCs and the
above relation. This approach should be tested in merging clus-
ters with lensing constraints in both subclusters, although early
results on the merging cluster MACS0416 suggest that this ap-
proach should be feasible (see Fig. 8 in Diego et al. 2024)
The final number of GCs (red points) in Fig. 2 is 28026 but
this does not account for the number of missing GCs in the
masked regions, which we estimated it to be≈3500. We ob-
tained this number of masked objects and their spatial distribu-
tion by first computing the density of GCs in every pixel in the
image,ρ gc(x,y), and then doing a Monte Carlo to simulate the
objects contained in the masked region.
To compute the continuous 2D surface density of GCs,ρ gc,
we convolved the discrete distribution by a function that depends
on the inverse of the distance to a GC,
ρgc(x,y)=Z
F(x,y)W(x−x′,y−y′)dx′dy′,(2)
whereF(x,y)=1 at the position of a GC and 0 otherwise andW
is the convolution kernel,
W(x−x′,y−y′)=1
(SL+d)α,(3)withdthe distance between positions (x,y) and (x′,y′) andS L
is a constant representing the softening length, needed to avoid
the convolution kernel to diverge ford=0. This approach
is similar to Sepherd’s algorithm whereα=2 is usually (but
not necessarily) adopted. In our case, we are interested in a
value ofαthat results inρ gc(x,y) reproducing the mass profile
from the lens model, soρ gc(x,y) can be also used as a proxy
for the lensing mass in future clusters with poor or no lensing
constraints. We find that a value ofα=1.6 results in a good fit to
the lens model profile (see section 6). The value of the softening
length is not as critical and values around 0”.5<S L<1”
produce satisfactory results. For this work we usedS L=0”.9.
The convolution is efficiently computed in Fourier space. A
first estimation of the density can be obtained even when there
are holes in the distribution of GCs, as for instance in the masked
regions. The relatively slow decline of the kernel with distance,
d−α, guarantees that even in the center of large masked regions
the density is not much smaller than in the edges. The density in
these regions is then a relatively good approximation to the ex-
pected density of GCs in the masked regions. We can use this
first estimation of the density to fill the holes, or inpaint the
masked region, through a Monte Carlo where we randomly place
GCs in the masked regions according to the pre-estimated den-
sity. The final result is shown in Fig. 2 with red points showing
the original distribution of GCs and black points showing the in-
painted GCs in the masked region. The process can be iterated
several times until the density converges, but for our particular
case, one simple iteration produces satisfactory enough results.
The edge portion of the mask is not inpainted since it is noisy
and contains too many spurious sources.
4. Lens model vs GC distribution
Following Harris et al. (2017), the total mass in GCs should
be 2.9×10−5times the total mass of the galaxy cluster. This
relation is applied at the virial radius and for the halo virial
mass. Neither the lens model nor the mapping of the GCs extend
to the virial radius (without gaps in the data such as the gap
between modules 1 and 2 in JWST data), so we take this relation
as an approximation. Instead we consider a radius of 60" which
is the maximum distance from the center at which we can detect
GCs in the main module. The total mass contained in the lens
model up to 60" is 4.23×1014M⊙, so the total mass in GCs
should be 2.9×10−5times smaller, or 8.47×109M⊙. Within
the same radius, we find 27895 GCs (including the inpainted
ones), so the average mass per GC isM=3.03×105M⊙, or in
log scale, log10(M)=5.48. This is just a little above the typical
mass of GCs in the Milky Way, where Baumgardt & Hilker
(2018) finds a mean log mass of log10(M)=5.2 and dispersion
σlog(M) =0.5, and comparable to expectations from N-body
simulations (Pfeffer et al. 2018).
Using the observed distribution of GCs (red points in Fig. 2)
plus the inpainted GCs (black points in the same figure), we in-
ject these distributions into Eq. 2 and recompute the 2D density
map of GCs in the entire field of view.
The result is shown in Fig. 4 in gray color. The contours of
the GC density are shown in green and we compare them with
the contours of the convergence,κ, from the lens model (paper-
I) in cyan. The agreement between contours is remarkable, con-
firming that the distribution of GCs can be used as an alternative
way of inferring the distribution of dark matter, even in the ab-
sence of strong lensing constraints. This technique may be par-

ticularly useful for low redshift clusters in which the low redshift
results in subcritical surface mass densities and hence no strong
lensing, while on the other hand the low redshift is a great ally
for the detection of more GCs in the galaxy cluster.
An alternative, more quantitative way, of showing the tight
relation betweenρ gcandκis shown in Fig. 5 where we plot the
pixel by pixel correlation betweenρ gc(x,y) andκ(x,y). For this
comparison, we renormalizeρ gcby the usual constant,β, which
minimizes the variance of the difference∆ =κ−β×ρ gcand is
simply given by:
β=R
κ(x,y)ρ gc(x,y)dxdyR
ρ2gc(x,y)dxdy(4)
The correspondence betweenρ gcandκis very good for values of
the convergence above log10(κ)≈−0.5 orκ≈0.3. For smaller
values ofκthe discrepancy is partially due to the shallower slope
of the assumed kernel (α=1.6 in Eq. 3) which extrapolates the
density at large radius (where GC are not detected or masked by
the edge portion of the mask), while DM is known to fall faster
(α≈2 or NFW-like). Also, at large radii the relative contribution
from background small galaxies, which are misidentified as GC
by our filtering algorithm become more relevant. We address the
possible level of contamination from foreground objects in the
next section.
5. Contamination level
We repeat the same process described in section 3 but in the
second module of the GLIMPSE data. This second module al-
lows us to detect GCs from 1.′8 (0.53 Mpc) to 4′(1.18 Mpc)
from the cluster center. Several bright stars fall in this module
that increases the size of the masked region. On the other hand,
fewer cluster members and no giant arcs are found in this mod-
ule. The number density of high redshift and compact galaxies

(that can contaminate our sample) is supposed to be the same
as in the main module as long as the luminosity function of
high-redshift galaxies is close to a power law with slope -2. This
would compensate for the magnification bias resulting in a uni-
form distribution of lensed galaxies. The resulting mask and de-
tected GCs candidates are shown in Figure 6. In total we detect
5327 GCs and estimate that 804 should have been detected in the
masked region. The average number density in the second mod-
ule is n GC=1.67×10−2kpc−2. The spatial distribution shows a
mild gradient in the north-south direction with a slight increase
in number density in the direction of the cluster center.
With the detection of GCs in the second module we estimate
the level of contamination from compact background galaxies as
the surface number density of GCs at the largest radii (0.015 GC
per kpc2, see next section). This represents a conservative upper
limit to the contamination, since some of these distant detections
are real GCs in the outskirts of the cluster.
6. The radial distribution of GCs
We show the one dimensional profiles of the GC distribution
and lensing mass in Fig. 7. The lensing mass profile derived
in paper-I (convergence atz s=3) is shown as a dark blue
line while the profile of GCs is shown as a thick black solid
line. For easier comparison with the lensing convergence, we
have re-scaled the number density of GCs by a factor 4. The
inner 1" is masked during the process of detecting clusters but
we perform a visual inspection in this region of the filtered
maps and detect GCs by eye in this small region (see Fig. 1).
This central 1" shows a small but noticeable deficit of GCs
when compared with neighboring regions. This could be due
to the higher photon noise at the center of the BCG which
makes detection of GCs more challenging. Although potentially
interesting, this apparent deficit in the number of GCs in the
central 1” is not reliable so we ignore distances smaller than 1”
in our analysis. We observe the number density of GCs remains
constant between 3” and 13”. This is similar to the trend
observed in the lensing mass. The number density of GCs starts
to decline abover≳13”. The decline in the lensing mass, or
convergence, starts at larger distances. Between 13”<r<60”
the GC number density falls approximately as the expectedr−2
found in simulations (Reina-Campos et al. 2023).
At even larger radii, we can derive the profile from the sec-
ond module of JWST-GLIMPSE that extends the field of view to

≈4′from the center and close to the virial radius of the cluster.
We repeat the same process as in the main module and derive the
profile of the number density of GCs. This is shown in the same
figure as a thick solid black line between radii 100”≲r≲250”.
We can use the profile at the largest radius as an upper limit for
the level of contamination from small compact background ob-
jects, which also enter our GC catalog. We estimate the level
of contamination as 0.015 GC per kpc2(or 14.7% the average
number density of GCs in the inner 60" radius region), shown as
a horizontal black dotted line in the figure. This value is above,
but still close to, the background contamination level estimated
in the outskirts of the Coma cluster from shallower HST-ACS
imaging in Peng et al. (2011). The corrected GC profiles ob-
tained after subtracting this level of contamination are shown
as a thin black solid line. At radiir>50”, the lensing mass
from our model in paper-I falls faster thanr−2. This is due to a
known bias in our lensing reconstruction beyond the maximum
radius constrained by lensing, but if GC are true tracers of dark
matter, the corrected GC profile shown in Fig. 7 suggests that
aroundr=100” the mass profile should still fall close tor−2.
For comparison we also show the profile of the light (including
the intracluster light) as observed in the F444W filter that has a
similar decline with radius as the GC distribution. However, be-
ing much fainter than individual GCs, the light profile can only
be detected at shorter distances from the center of the cluster (see
also Montes & Trujillo 2019), while GCs can be detected all the
way (and beyond) the virial radius.
The light profile (or baryons, orange line) determines the
shape of the lensing model (blue line) in the innerr<2”, but
beyond this radius the projected mass profile is dominated by
the contribution from DM. From this plot, it is evident that the
mismatch between the intracluster light (core or few kpc) and
projected mass in the lens model (large core). Meanwhile, the
GC distribution, although with a somewhat smaller core than the
lensing convergence profile, resembles much better the distribu-
Fig. 7.Profiles of AS1063 centered on the BCG. The projected mass
from the lens model is plotted as dark blue (in units ofΣ/Σ crit) with
the two blue vertical dotted lines marking the range of distances with
lensing constraints. The light profile (including the intracluster light)
in the filter F444W is shown as an orange line. The map of the light
is masked and only the unamasked pixels are used for the profile. The
masked BCG results in a nil light profile at the very center. The number
density of GCs is shown as a thick black line that is re-scaled by a factor
four to match the convergence profile for easier comparison. The gap in
the profile corresponds to the gap between the two modules where no
GCs are detected. The GC number density profile at large radii (100”≲
r≲250”), is computed in the second module. After subtracting the
estimated level of contamination from background objects (horizontal
dotted line), the resulting corrected profile is shown in black as a thin
solid line.
tion of dark matter and shows also a large core. The similarity
between the GC and DM profiles is better highlighted when we
compare the profile of the continuous 2D distribution of GCs,
orρ gc(given by Eq. 2) with the lens model. This is shown as a
red curve in Fig. 7. The agreement with the lens model is excel-
lent in the region constrained by lensing. Abover≈50” the red
curve (ρ GC) is above the blue one (κ) due mostly to the biased
low lensing solution beyond the constrained region and the shal-
lower decline in the smoothing kernel ofρ GCat radii where we
do not have GCs.
7. Conclusions
We take advantage of the exceptionally deep images taken as
part of JWST’s GLIMPSE program in AS1063, to detect the
faint population of GCs in this cluster. We find tens of thousands
of GCs in the central module and thousands in the second
module that extend the coverage up to distances close to the
virial radius. We find a good correlation between the spatial
distribution of GCs and lensing mass. We define a smoothing
kernel that can transform the discrete distribution of GCs into a
continuous distribution that resembles the lensing convergence.
Similar transformations can be used in other clusters in which
lensing constraints are not available (for instance in low redshift
subcritical clusters) in order to get a proxy for the mass distribu-
tion. We compare pixel-by-pixel the smoothed GC distribution
with the lensing convergence and find a good correspondence.
We also detect GCs in the second module and set the upper
limit of the contamination from background objects as the
density of GCs at the largest radius. After correcting for this
contamination, the derived GC profile falls approximately asr−2

up to the largest radius probed by our analysis.
GCs offer an alternative proxy for the spatial distribution of
lensing mass in clusters, a fact that can be exploited in future
analysis of galaxy clusters that show, or do not show, strong lens-
ing features.
