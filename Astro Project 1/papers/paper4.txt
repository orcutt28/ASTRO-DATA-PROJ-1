Abstract
The collapse of large-amplitude primordial curvature perturbations into planetary-mass primordial black holes
generates a scalar-induced gravitational wave background in theµHz frequency range that may be detectable
by future Lunar Laser Ranging and Satellite Laser Ranging data. We derive projected constraints on the
primordial black hole population from a null detection of stochastic gravitational wave background by these
experiments, including the impact of the electroweak phase transition on the abundance of planetary-mass
primordial black holes. We also discuss the connection between the obtained projected constraints and the
recent microlensing observations by the HSC collaboration of the Andromeda Galaxy.

1. Introduction
In recent years, Primordial Black Holes (PBHs)
have garnered renewed interest as they might ex-
plain some of the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observa-
tions and significantly contribute to the amount of
dark matter today (see for a recent review Ref. [1]).
Among the various formation mechanisms proposed,
the standard scenario involves the collapse of large-
amplitude curvature perturbations generated during
inflation, whose characteristic scale also determines
the frequency of the associated Scalar-Induced Grav-
itational Wave background (SIGWs) through
f∼10−9HzMPBH

This connection between PBH mass and GW fre-
quency enables the study of PBH formation acrossa wide mass range using different ongoing and future
experiments.
Current Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) observa-
tions [2–10] are already sensitive to a potential SIGW
signal in the nHz regime, expected from the forma-
tion of (sub)solar-mass PBHs, while the space-based
interferometer LISA [11] will be able to explore the
frequency band, i.e. mHz, associated with asteroid-
mass PBHs. Therefore, these mass ranges have been
extensively investigated in the literature (see, e.g.
Refs. [12–25]). Conversely, the planetary-mass win-
dow (M PBH∼[10−7,10−4]M⊙) remains compara-
tively unexplored. Although such PBHs have long
been considered in connection with microlensing ob-
servations [26–33], no dedicated experiment has yet
been realized to specifically target SIGWs associated
with this mass range. Several concepts were proposed
a few years ago [34–38], but none of them have pro-
Preprint submitted to Elsevier February 13, 2026arXiv:2602.12252v1  [astro-ph.CO]  12 Feb 2026
gressed beyond the preliminary design or proposal
stage.
More recently, Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) and
Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) [39, 40] have emerged
as a promising avenue to explore this mass-frequency
regime directly. The key idea is to exploit the reso-
nant response of gravitationally bound systems, such
as the Earth-Moon and Earth-satellite binaries, to
long-wavelength GWs in theµHz band. A stochas-
tic GW background induces time-dependent pertur-
bations of the orbital elements, which can be probed
through high-precision laser-ranging measurements.
In this work, after briefly reviewing the formalism
to compute the PBH abundance and the SIGWs in
Section 2, we briefly describe in Section 3 the pro-
posed experiments. In Section 4 we constrain the am-
plitude and shape of the primordial curvature power
spectrum, under the assumption that the SIGW
background produced does not reach the future sen-
sitivity of LLR, and some possible SLR missions. We
then discuss how these constraints can be translated
into bounds on the PBH abundance, including also
the effects of the Electroweak (EW) phase transition
on the threshold for PBH formation, and the con-
nection with existing PBHs microlensing limits and
observations. Finally, we summarize our conclusions
in Section 5.
2. Review of PBH formation and SIGWs
In this section, we provide a brief summary of the
main definitions and formulae relevant for the com-
putation of the PBH abundance and the associated
background of SIGWs. Throughout the paper, we
assume, for simplicity, that the primordial curvature
perturbationζfollows a Gaussian distribution. Fol-
lowing a model-independent approach, we character-
ize the curvature power spectrum with a log-normal
profile, defined by a peak scalek ⋆, an amplitudeA,
and a width ∆,
PζG(k) =A√
2π∆exp
−ln2(k/k ⋆)
2∆2
. (2)
We also assume that the Universe is radiation-
dominated, except when accounting for modifications
of the equation of state (EoS) in the calculation for
the PBH abundance. Instead, in our SIGW compu-
tation, we neglect subleading effects such as the vari-
ation of the sound speedc s, across the EW and QCD
transitions (see e.g. Refs. [19, 41, 42]).2.1. PBH formation: threshold statistics and peak
theory
Large-amplitude curvature perturbations could
collapse into PBHs after re-entering the cosmologi-
cal horizon (horizon crossing). The resulting PBH
mass follows the critical scaling relation [43–45]
MPBH(C) =KM k(C − C th)γ,(3)
whereCis the peak of the compaction function mea-
suring the perturbation amplitude, and the collapse
occurs only if it exceeds the thresholdC th, whose
value, as we will describe in the next section, depends
on the power spectrum shape [46]. The horizon mass

The precise determination of the PBH mass spec-
trum remains uncertain because different approxima-
tion schemes can be used, and there is no agreement
on which is the most consistent. The two most com-
mon formalisms arethreshold statisticsandpeak the-
ory, both of which can be recast in the form of Eq. (5),
with different prescriptions forP k(C) [18, 21]. As we
will demonstrate, our results are robust with respect
to the method with which the PBH mass spectrum is
computed.
Threshold statistics.Here, the probability is inferred
from the statistics of the compaction function [48, 49],

2.2. PBH formation during the EW transition
The gravitational collapse leading to the formation
of a PBH occurs when the maximum value of the
compaction function,C(r m), exceeds a critical thresh-
old. This is measuring the perturbation amplitude
for which there is a perfect equivalence between self-
gravity and pressure gradients, corresponding to the
asymptotic limit of a zero-mass black hole. In gen-
eral, the value ofC this not universal but depends on
the shape profile of the cosmological perturbations
collapsing into PBHs, i.e. the profile ofζ, which is
ultimately determined by the shape of the curvaturepower spectrum [46, 58, 59]. In this work we fol-
low Ref. [46], where a practical prescription is given
to evaluate the collapse parameters directly from the
curvature power spectrum.
For completeness, we summarize below the key
steps required to compute the shape parameterα s
and the corresponding value of thresholdC th.

function,r m, is obtained numerically by solving the

The left panel of Fig. 1 illustrates the dependence of
the collapse thresholdC thand of the shape parameter
αson the shape of the log-normal curvature power
spectrum introduced in Eq. 2.
The dynamics of PBH formation are very sensitive
to the EoS of the primordial plasma, showing features
of critical collapse. In this context, the EoS plays a
crucial role: PBH production is enhanced whenever
the EoS softens, as it temporarily reduces the effect
of the pressure against gravitational collapse.
During the EW phase transition, changes in the
effective number of relativistic degrees of freedomg ⋆
and the associated variation in the sound speedc s
modify the background expansion rate and the pres-
sure gradients opposing the collapse. In particular, a
transient softening of the EoS around the EW scale
reduces the resistance to gravitational collapse, lower-
ing the threshold and enhancing the PBH formation
probability during this epoch [55, 61–70].

In this paper, we extend the state-of-the-art of nu-
merical simulations presented in Ref. [70] to deter-
mine the threshold valueC thduring the EW phase
transition. The results are shown in the right panel
of Fig. 1. The EW transition affects PBH masses in
a range from∼5×10−7M⊙to∼10−3M⊙when
the Universe enters the QCD transition. We find
that the correction on the thresholdC this modest, at
the level ofO(1%), with the main correction around
∼[3,4]×10−5M⊙, wherec2
sreaches the minimum
value of 0.32.1. This small change on the threshold
justifies the previous assumption of the mass distri-
bution following critical collapse behavior of a radia-
tion dominated universe, i.e. Eq. 3. In the numerical
computations, while we fixγ= 0.36 as in a radi-
ation dominated universe, we take into account the
shape dependence onK, varying its value in the range
K ∈[3.4,9] forα s∈[6,0.5], following the prescription
of Ref. [70].
We observe, fully in agreement with Ref. [70] where
similar simulations were performed during the QCD
phase transition, that broader profiles, corresponding
to smaller values ofα s, exhibit a stronger sensitivity
to variations in the EoS and shift the main correction
to smaller masses. More details on the EoS used in
the numerical calculations to compute the threshold
are given in the Appendix.
1For comparison, QCD effects lead to significantly larger
corrections on the thresholdC th, at theO(10%) level, around
MPBH∼3M ⊙[55, 70] because of the larger softening of the
EoS with respect to the EW transition.2.3. Scalar-induced gravitational waves

of such waves induces a tidal acceleration on the rel-
ative separation vector with an oscillating pattern,
thereby exciting harmonics of the orbital frequency
and producing time-dependent perturbations in the
osculating orbital elements that may accumulate with
time, as well as in the round-trip light-travel time
measured by LLR. Since the Earth-Moon baseline,
i.e. the nominal orbital separation predicted by high-
precision ephemerides, is known with exquisite accu-
racy, the perturbations from a very weak stochastic
signal model are expected to be distinguishable from
other effects [39, 40, 86].
In addition, we consider high-eccentricity orbits for
laser-ranging that extend both current lunar and ter-
restrial capacities.
i) First, we study an eccentric lunar-orbit configu-
ration (eLO), in which a satellite orbiting the Moon
on a highly eccentric trajectory is tracked with a
precision comparable to that of LLR. As done in
Ref. [40], we adopt orbital parameters correspond-
ing to a period of 6.5 days and an eccentricity of
0.7. These parameters are representative of orbits
currently planned for lunar navigation infrastruc-
tures such asGateway[87]. While achieving the re-
quired laser-ranging precision for such missions would
be challenging, this configuration provides a realis-tic benchmark for assessing the potential sensitivity
of future lunar satellite tracking to long-wavelength
GWs.
ii) Second, we consider eccentric Satellite Laser
Ranging (eSLR) scenarios involving artificial satel-
lites on highly eccentric Earth orbits. In this case,
the Earth-satellite system forms a gravitationally
bound binary whose large eccentricity, like in the
case of eLO, enhances the resonant response to long-
wavelength GWs and results in amplified perturba-
tions of the orbital elements. As an illustrative exam-
ple, we use the orbit of the Magnetospheric Multiscale
(MMS) mission, which was briefly laser ranged [40].
Although MMS was not designed as an SLR mission,
and therefore does not provide the precision assumed
in our projections, a future SLR experiment with sim-
ilar orbital parameters is possible with current tech-
nologies. Other SLR missions which realize less ec-
centric and shorter-period orbits are also discussed in
Ref. [40].
A summary of the relevant GW sensitivities and
the corresponding horizon mass ranges as a function
of frequency is shown in Fig. 2. Sensitivities via the
binary resonance mechanism for the LLR, eLO, and
eSLR scenarios are adopted from Ref. [86] and depend
in detail on the assumptions made in that work.
5
In the case of LLR, the projected sensitivities corre-
spond to those achievable with 15 years of statistics-
limited laser-ranging measurements and the assump-
tion of the absence of degeneracies between the ef-
fects of a GW and other model parameters. For the
satellite scenarios (eLO and eSLR), the correspond-
ing missions do not exist, though the curves are based
on ranging possibilities allowed by current technolo-
gies [39, 40, 86]. Nonetheless, we anticipate that the
prospects of detection of GWs from Ref. [40] will crys-
tallize in a mission along this concept in the following
years.
4. Potential Constraints on PBH population
The non-detection of a stochastic SIGW back-
ground in theµHz frequency band by future LLR,
eLO and eSLR observations can be directly translated
into constraints on the abundance of PBHs in the
planetary-mass window. Since SIGWs are inevitably
produced by the same large-amplitude curvature per-
turbations responsible for PBH formation, any exper-
imental upper bound on Ω GWimplies an upper limit
on the amplitude of the primordial curvature power
spectrum and, consequently, on the PBH mass func-
tion2.
We develop projected sensitivities toAas a func-
tion ofk ⋆for SIGWs using the Fisher forecasting pro-
cedure for binary resonances developed in [86]. The
procedure is as follows. In our log-normal spectrum
model, the SIGW spectrum is fully determined by
{k⋆, A,∆}. At fixed values ofk ⋆and ∆, using the
machinery of [40, 86], we compute the covariance for
the binary resonance signal generated by that SIGW
spectrum, which we denoteΣ(A|k ⋆,∆).Because the
SIGW spectrum and therefore the signal covariance
scale linearly withA2, it is most convenient to define
Σ(k ⋆,∆)≡Σ(A= 1|k ⋆,∆) so that
Σ(A|k ⋆,∆) =A2Σ(k ⋆,∆).(19)
The sensitivity to the squared amplitude parameter
A2, denoted byσ A2and the corresponding value ofA2
at which the signal-to-noise ratio is unity can then be
calculated, assuming white noise measurement errors,
2We stress that assuming the observed signal to be entirely
of SIGW origin is a conservative choice. If additional sources
contributed to the signal, a smaller value ofAwould be re-
quired, resulting in stronger bounds on PBH formation.

whereσis the measurement precision. We adopt
identical measurement precisions, observing ca-
dences, and observing durations from [40]. The ex-
pected sensitivity toA2can then be trivially related
to the expected sensitivity toA.
We evaluate our projected sensitivity toAin the
∆ = 0.1 and ∆ = 1.0 scenarios at 1000 log-spaced
values between values ofk ⋆between 107Mpc−1and
1012Mpc−1. The results are shown in Fig. 3. For
narrow power spectra, ∆ = 0.1, the SIGW spectrum
exhibits a characteristic double-peak structure [88],
which translates into two local minima in the allowed
amplitudeAfor each individual experiment (see also
for instance Fig. 2). When combining all experiments,
the resulting constraint (either solid or dashed black
lines) displays four local minima: three associated
with the dominant sensitivity ranges of LLR, eLO and
eSLR, and an additional feature at largek ⋆induced
by the secondary peak in the eSLR case. This extra
minimum disappears for broader spectra, such as ∆ =
1, where the SIGW spectrum becomes smoother and
the constraints are correspondingly relaxed. When
combining the sensitivities, because one observation
typically dominates the expected sensitivity, rather
than projecting a joint analysis, we merely take the
maximal sensitivity envelope for simplicity.
The constraints in the (k ⋆, A) plane can be mapped

of the PBH abundance formalism used. A narrow
window around⟨M PBH⟩ ≃2×10−5M⊙remains for-
mally allowed, but only at abundancesf PBH≲10−10,
rendering PBHs negligible as a dark matter compo-
nent. For broader spectra, ∆ = 1, the exclusion
region relaxes at lighter masses, but PBHs are still
ruled out in the interval∼[10−7,10−4]M⊙. Re-
markably, a non-detection by eLO could fully ex-
clude the possibility that the events detected by
OGLE+HSC [28, 29, 89, 90] (orange region) are of
primordial origin; while in the case of broad spectrum
only eSLR can fully exclude the same possibility for
the recent claim presented by HSC [91] (pink region).
Taking into account individual experiments, the
constraints at the lowest PBH masses are system-
atically dominated by eSLR, largely independent of
the spectral width. In particular, around⟨M PBH⟩ ∼
10−5M⊙, corresponding to SIGW frequencies most
sensitive to the EW phase transition, the bounds are
entirely driven by eSLR. In this mass range, the tem-
porary softening of the equation of state during the
EW phase transition mildly enhances PBH forma-
tion, leading to a slightly more stringent upper limit
onf PBH. At larger masses,⟨M PBH⟩ ∼10−4M⊙,
the constraints are instead dominated by eLO, while
those from LLR are found to be subdominant or neg-
ligible compared to existing microlensing bounds. For
narrow spectra, the dominance alternates between
LLR and eLO, reflecting the interplay between the
sharp SIGW spectral features and the experimental
sensitivity curves.

5. Conclusions
In this work, we computed the projected con-
straints on the amplitude of the curvature power spec-
trum, requiring that the amplitude of the resulting
SIGW background does not exceed the future sen-
sitivity of the proposed LLR, eLO and eSLR ex-
periments. When PBHs form through the collapse
of large curvature perturbations, these bounds on
SIGWs can be directly translated into upper limits
on the PBH abundance. We derived these limits
in different scenarios, estimating the PBH popula-
tion using both threshold statistics and peak theory.
Conversely, a detection of a SIGW signal in theµHz
band would provide compelling evidence for PBH for-
mation processes tied to early-Universe physics, with
particular sensitivity to epochs such as the EW phase
transition.
Our results show that, in the absence of a detected
SIGW signal, future laser-ranging experiments have
the potential to severely constrain the existence of
PBHs in the planetary-mass window. For narrow cur-
vature power spectra, PBHs are excluded over essen-
tially the entire mass rangeM PBH∼[10−8,10−5]M⊙,
independently of the PBH formation formalism, with
only a narrow mass interval remaining allowed at
abundances so small that PBHs are observation-
ally irrelevant. Instead, for broader spectra, the
constraints exclude the entire mass rangeM PBH∼
[10−7,10−4]M⊙.
AroundM∼10−5M⊙, corresponding to SIGW
frequencies affected by the electroweak phase transi-
tion, the projected bounds are dominated by eSLR
and remain strong enough to push the allowed PBH
abundance below the level corresponding to fewer
than one PBH within the present Hubble volume. At
larger masses, the constraints are instead driven by
eLO, while those from LLR are found to be subdom-
inant or comparable to existing microlensing bounds,
depending on the spectral width. Moreover, a non-
detection from these experiments would exclude the
possibility that candidate events seen by several mi-
crolensing experiments [28, 29, 89–91] are of primor-
dial origin.
Although these constraints are indirect, as they
arise from the non-detection of SIGWs rather than
from direct PBH observations, if realized, they would
represent the leading bounds on the abundance of
planetary-mass PBHs over a large region of pa-
rameter space. As such, they provide a powerfulcomplement to microlensing searches and establish
laser-ranging experiments as a novel probe of early-
Universe physics, particularly of PBH formation dur-
ing epochs in which the EoS of the primordial plasma
deviates from the radiation dominated Universe, as
during the EW phase transition.
Several extensions of this work are worth explor-
ing. A first direction concerns extending the analy-
sis to very broad power spectra for which the com-
putation of the PBH abundance is still under de-
bate [99, 100] and the inclusion of primordial non-
Gaussianities, which can substantially affect both the
PBH abundance and the associated scalar-induced
gravitational-wave background [18, 21, 25]. An-
other avenue is the study of PBH formation mech-
anisms beyond the standard collapse of large cur-
vature perturbations [1, 101]. These include col-
lapses induced by attractive long range force [102–
113], late-blooming during first-order phase transi-
tions [114–137], late-annihilation of domain-wall net-
works [138–145], domain-wall networks bounded by
cosmic strings [146–148], spherical domains generated
during inflation [149–160] or from eternally inflating
regions [161].

Appendix: Equation of State in the Early Universe
The matter content of the early Universe after the
end of inflation is made by relativistic matter de-
scribed by the EoSp=ρ/3, where the pressurepis
proportional toρ, the total energy density of the fluid.
This simple form of the EoS, is obtained in the ap-
proximation of a perfect fluid (no shear, no viscosity),
when the rest mass density is negligible with respect
to the kinetic component. Afterwards the Universe
is matter dominated (p= 0), i.e. the same perfect
fluid approximation in the opposite limit, although
strictly speaking this holds only for the background
solution and at linear order of cosmological perturba-
tions, while during the formation of structures, like
stars and galaxies, a more sophisticated EoS needs to

s, and the
equation of state parameterw(T)≡p/ρduring the EW phase
transition as a function of the cosmological horizon massM k
in units of a solar mass.
be taken into account, including the velocity disper-
sion of particles.
During the radiation dominated epoch, the temper-
ature decreases with cosmic expansion with matter
going through several transitions, characterized by a
non-negligible softening of the equation of state, in-
troducing an intrinsic scale into the problem. These
include the electroweak transition at temperature
T∼100 GeV, periods of quark annihilation, the QCD
confinement transition atT∼100 MeV and the pri-
mordial nucleosynthesis withe+e−annihilation at
T∼500 keV.
Here we are interested in the formalism that can be
applied to the EW and QCD transitions, assuming
for simplicity the chemical potentialµ= 0 as in the
calculations of [162, 163], describing a transition in
equilibrium. This is an excellent approximation in
the context of the early Universe due to the smallness
of the cosmic baryon-to-photon ratio, which givesµ∼
10−10.
The QCD and the electroweak transition
Using detailed lattice gauge calculations, consider-
ing realistic quark masses, one can compute the EoS
at zero chemical potential for the QCD transition in
the early Universe. The ratiowbetween pressurep
and total energy densityρof the medium is given by
w(T)≡p
ρ=4g⋆s(T)
3g⋆(T)−1,(22)
where the functionsg ⋆(T) andg ⋆s(T) are defined by
g⋆(T)≡30ρ
π2T4andg ⋆s(T)≡45s
2π2T3,(23)
9
withsbeing the entropy density. The square of the
speed of soundc2
s≡∂p/∂ρ| smay be computed as
c2
s(T) =4(4g ⋆s+Tg′
⋆s)
3(4g ⋆+Tg′⋆)−1,(24)
where a prime denotes a derivative with respect to
temperature.
These lattice calculations show clearly that the
QCD quark-to-hadron transition is not a phase tran-
sition but a cross-over. Ref. [162] in particular has
added to these calculations results from the litera-
ture concerning the electroweak transition to provide
the cosmic equation of state betweenT≃280 GeV
andT≃1 MeV.
Fig. 5 shows the evolution of the sound speed
squared,c2
s, and of the equation-of-state parameter
w(T)≡p/ρacross the electroweak (EW) phase tran-
sition. The horizontal axis is expressed in terms
of the cosmological horizon massM k, normalized
to the solar massM ⊙. In this parametrization, ef-
fects from the EW transition occur in the range
Mk≃5×10−7M⊙toM k≃10−3M⊙, after which
effects from the QCD transition become dominant,
see e.g. [55]. The full evolution of the equation of
state, including the QCD transition and the epoch of
e+e−annihilation, is shown in Fig. 1 of Ref. [70].
