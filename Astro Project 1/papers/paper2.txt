Abstract
We report the multi-temperature structure of the intracluster medium (ICM) in the Centaurus cluster core observed with XRISM/Resolve. Thanks
to its high energy resolution, Resolve enables us to measure fine structures of highly ionized emission lines from Si to Fe and to directly determine
the excitation temperature and the ionization temperature from the emission line ratio diagnostics. The observed spectrum in the Centaurus core
is well-represented by a double-temperature thermal plasma at collisional ionization equilibrium state rather than an isothermal one. The line
ratio diagnostics also support this biphasic temperature structure. Particularly, the observed line ratios show a trend of increasing ionization
temperature with atomic mass, while the ionization and excitation temperatures of Fe show nearly the same temperature. The resultant line
ratios, which are well-represented by the two temperatures ICM,∼1.6and∼3keV, are also fairly consistent with the expected numbers when
assuming the radial single-temperature ICM was projected in the cluster core along the line of sight. Due to the limited low-energy sensitivity of
the Resolve with the gate valve closed, we investigated the effect of the cool component using the XMM-Newton/RGS spectrum, but it ultimately
did not affect our results. The observed flux ratio between the FeXXVHeαresonance and forbidden lines shows an about 20% reduction,
suggesting the presence of resonant scattering.

1 Introduction
Galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally bound structures in
the Universe. They consist of dark matter, hot gas, and galax-
ies, with the intracluster medium (ICM) being the dominant com-
ponent that can be observed through electromagnetic radiation
(e.g., Ikebe et al. 1997; Sarazin et al. 1998). Their thermo-dynamic properties, including temperature structure and hydro-
static equilibrium, are important for estimating cluster masses,
which directly constrain cosmological parameters (e.g., Allen et
al. 2001; Makishima et al. 2001). Despite the fact that radiative
cooling should be effective in the relatively dense environment
of the cluster core region, X-ray observations have revealed that
many galaxy clusters have cool cores, regions where the tempera-

ture stops decreasing and is maintained at a certain level. X-ray ob-
servations have indeed shown low-temperature gas in cool cores;
however, the quantity of this gas is significantly lower than ex-
pected (e.g., Peterson et al. 2001; Tamura et al. 2001; Kaastra et
al. 2001; Peterson & Fabian 2006). Active galactic nuclei (AGNs)
are often found in the cores of galaxies, so they are often thought
to be the heating sources (e.g., McNamara & Nulsen 2007). The
energy could be transferred to the surrounding ICM through sound
waves (e.g., Fabian et al. 2006), shocks (e.g., Randall et al. 2015),
cosmic rays (e.g., Fujita et al. 2013), and turbulence (e.g., Kim &
Narayan 2003). Understanding the temperature structure of cool-
core clusters enables us to trace the history of cooling, heating,
and gas mixing processes that shaped their cores. Recent X-ray
CCD observations with Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Suzaku have
revealed that multi-temperature models accurately represent the
multi-phase ICM structure in cool cores (e.g., Abell 4059: Mernier
et al. 2015, Hydra A: Simionescu et al. 2009, Abell 496: Ghizzardi
et al. 2014).
The temperature measurements of the ICM with X-ray CCD
have mainly been derived from the continuum spectral shape,
which is affected by uncertainties such as the effective area and
background modeling. In addition, the coupling between the tem-
perature of the continuum shape and abundances from emission
lines makes it difficult to determine the accurate temperature due
to insufficient energy resolution capability. In particular, the Fe-L
complex around 1 keV has been reported to significantly affect the
temperature measurements. The temperature measurements based
on emission line ratios from different energy levels are less af-
fected by such uncertainties. Before the Hitomi era, such temper-
ature measurements were conducted only using strong emission
lines.
The high spectral resolution of Hitomi enabled precise diagnos-
tics of the thermal and dynamical states of the ICM in the Perseus
cluster. Hitomi Collaboration et al. (2018c) performed the direct
measurement of not only the electron temperature but also vari-
ous ionization degrees of elements from Si to Fe using the Hitomi
observation of the Perseus cluster. They also report the excita-
tion temperature derived from the same ionization state, such asLyβ/Lyα, and the ionization temperature from the different ion-
ization state, such as Lyα/Heα, from the emission line diagnos-
tics. While most line ratios are largely consistent with a single-
temperature CIE plasma, small deviations are identified: the ion-
ization temperature increases with atomic mass, and the excitation
temperature is lower than the ionization temperature for Fe in the
core. These results agree with a multi-temperature structure pro-
jected along the line of sight using the temperature profile from
Chandra. The dynamical properties of the ICM were constrained
by emission line widths of S, Ca, and Fe (Hitomi Collaboration
et al. 2018a), measuring both the line-of-sight velocity dispersion
of random motion, including turbulence,σ v, and of the thermal
motion of ions,σ th. The resultant ion temperature from the line
width is consistent with the electron temperature within the 68%
confidence level.
Finally, the FeXXVHeαresonance line (w) was found to be
suppressed toward the core, and its width was broader than the
other FeXXVtriplet lines (Hitomi Collaboration et al. 2018b). The
expected turbulent velocities required to reproduce the observed
fluxes of Fe Heα w(optically thick), Heαforbidden (z), Heβ,
andXXVILyα(optically thin) in Monte Carlo radiative-transfer
simulations were consistent with direct measurements.
An X-ray microcalorimeter spectrometer, Resolve (Kelley et al.
2025), onboard XRISM satellite (Tashiro et al. 2025) enables us
to perform the high-resolution spectroscopy of the ICM in galaxy
clusters. As for direct measurements of the ICM thermal struc-
ture, observations of Abell 2029 demonstrated an intriguing re-
sult. Sarkar et al. (2025) investigated the multi-temperature struc-
ture of Abell 2029 using line diagnostics. Detailed line diagnos-
tics using the XRISM satellite have so far been carried out only
for Abell 2029. In addition to the Perseus cluster observed with
Hitomi and Abell 2029, it is essential to perform temperature mea-
surements for clusters across other temperature ranges as well. For
instance, intermediate-temperature clusters allow the use of not
only Fe lines but also Si and S lines, which are predominantly
emitted by cooler gas, for detailed line diagnostics. The Centaurus
cluster is one of the nearest X-ray bright clusters. The AGN of its
central galaxy, NGC 4696, is quieter than that of the Perseus clus-
ter. Its central temperature is lower than that of the Perseus clus-
ter. In terms of AGN activity and ICM temperature, the Centaurus
cluster is a suitable target for comparison with the Perseus cluster.
Previous studies with Chandra have revealed complex dynamical
structures in the central region (Sanders & Fabian 2002). These
studies identified a plume-like structure extending approximately
60 arcseconds from the cluster center and found that the temper-
ature increases sharply near the end of the plume, indicating the
presence of a cold front.
The presence of multi-temperature plasma in the Centaurus
cluster core has been reported (Fukazawa et al. 1994; Ikebe et
al. 1999). Based on Chandra observations, Sanders et al. (2016)
showed two-dimensional deviation maps of surface brightness,
temperature, and metallicity relative to the azimuthally averaged
distribution of the ICM. They found positive correlations between
the low-temperature and high-surface-brightness regions, as well
as between the metal-rich and high-surface-brightness regions.
These spatial correlations were interpreted as evidence of gas mo-
tions induced by sloshing. Sanders et al. (2008) found a cool com-
ponent (0.3–0.45 keV) in the core of the Centaurus cluster based
on the ratio of the FeXVII17.1 Å lines to the 15.0 Å line and
limits on OVIIemission with the XMM-Newton RGS. They also
reported that the amount of cool gas detected is significantly lower
than that predicted by the cooling-flow model. Other character-

istics of the Centaurus cluster are the high Fe abundance (∼1.5
Solar, e.g., Sanders & Fabian 2002). Fukushima et al. (2022) re-
ported temperature and metal abundances using Chandra ACIS-S,
XMM-Newton MOS, pn, and RGS data. In the innermost region
within 5 arcsec from the cluster center, the RGS spectrum was
well-represented by a three-temperature model, with the hottest
component at3.02±0.09keV and an emission-measure-weighted
temperature of1.6±0.8keV .
XRISM observed Centaurus as one of the first targets during
its Performance Verification (PV) phase, following the calibration
phase. The first study presented its Resolve spectrum, as well as a
map of its bulk and turbulent gas velocity measurements (XRISMCollaboration et al. 2025a). This study uses the same deep dataset
to examine the ICM temperature. Details on abundances are stud-
ied in Mernier et al. (2026) and Fukushima et al. in preparation.
Throughout this paper, we performed the spectral analysis using
the Xspec 12.14.1 package and used the AtomDB version 3.1.3 to
reproduce CIE plasma spectra. We adopted the solar abundance
table provided by Lodders et al. (2009). The Galactic hydrogen
column density ofN H= 7.77×1020cm−2(HI4PI Collaboration
et al. 2016) in the direction of the Centaurus cluster, the same as in
XRISM Collaboration et al. (2025a), was adopted for the spectral
analysis, unless noted otherwise. Errors are given at the 1σ(68%)
confidence level.

2 Observation and data reduction
2.1 XRISM/Resolve
XRISM carried out an observation of the core region of the
Centaurus cluster from December 28th, 2023, to January 3rd, 2024
(OBSID=000138000). The aim point was located1′northwest of
NGC 4696. We used only the Resolve instrument (Kelley et al.
2025) in this paper. The observed region with XRISM/Resolve
is shown in figure 1. During this observation, the gate valve was
closed, and data in theE>∼2 keV band were available. Data reduc-
tion was basically performed on the entire field of view (FoV) of
Resolve according to the XRISM Data Reduction Guide1, except
that pixel 27 was included in the spectral analysis as described in
XRISM Collaboration et al. (2025a). The non-X-ray background
(NXB) model2of the Resolve distributed by the XRISM team was
included within the spectral fit model. The cleaned exposure time
after screening was 287.4 ksec. We used only high-resolution pri-

2https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xrism/analysis/nxb/nxb_spectral_models.htmlmary events. In this study, we only performed the spectral fitting
from the entire region of the Resolve, without dividing the region
into subregions.
2.2 XMM-Newton/RGS
Two XMM-Newton observations capture the center of NGC 4696
at the RGS pointing position (den Herder et al. 2001). In this pa-
per, we used only the longer exposure data (obsID=0406200101)
to avoid the impact of differences in roll angles and observa-
tion coordinates on the fitting results, as shown in Mernier et al.
(2026). The data reduction procedure of the XMM-Newton RGS
data was performed with XMM-Newton Science Analysis System
(SAS) version 21.0. We processed the RGS1 and RGS2 data with
thergsproctask in the SAS package. The exposure times after
filtering for RGS1 and RGS2 were 119.2 ksec and 113.8 ksec,
respectively. Following Fukushima et al. (2022), the first- and
second-order RGS spectra were extracted by specifying the rect-
angular cross-dispersion limits of the source regions, rather than
using thexpsfincltask in the SAS package. We extracted the
spectra with a 2′width region along the cross-dispersion direction
within the central chip of the MOS detectors, centered on (R.A.,
Dec.) J2000.0 =(12h48m49.s05,−41◦18′46.′′1). This spectral extrac-
tion region is shown in figure 1. As for the dispersion direction, it
is difficult to derive the spatial information from the RGS spectra
of extended sources, such as the ICM.
3 Spectral analysis and results
3.1 Spectral analysis with XRISM/Resolve
3.1.1 Single-temperature approach
We first fitted the Resolve spectrum for the entire region in the
1.8–12 keV energy band, with a thermal plasma model (bvvapec
model, Smith et al. 2001), multiplied by an absorption model
(tbabs model, Wilms et al. 2000) to account for the Galactic ab-
sorption. The spectrum is binned so as to have a minimum of
1 count per energy bin. We fit the spectrum using C-statistics
(Cash 1979). The model formula can be expressed as follows:
tbabs×bvvapec(hereafter, we refer to this model as the “1T”
model). We fixed the abundances of elements from C to Al at 1.5
Solar. The abundances of Si, S, Ar, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ni were
Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan(2025), Vol. 00, No. 05
left free, while those of the remaining elements between Si and Zn
were linked to the Fe abundance.
The spectrum is shown in figure 2 and the best-fit parameters
are summarized in tables 1 and 2. Although the overall continuum
is reasonably reproduced with the “1T” model, positive residuals
are seen at the S Heαlines and at the Fe Lyαlines, while neg-
ative residuals appear at the FeXXVHeαresonance (w) line (see
figure 2). If this resonance line is suppressed by resonant scatter-
ing, the velocity dispersion would be overestimated, whereas the
Fe abundance would be underestimated, because both quantities
are predominantly constrained by the line profile of the Fe Heα
complex (Hitomi Collaboration et al. 2018b). To mitigate this is-
sue, we excluded the FeXXVHeα wline from AtomDB and added
azgausscomponent into the model formula to the line (“Resolve
1T w/ zgauss” model). The line centroid energy for thezgauss
component was fixed at6.7004keV, and its redshift was tied to
that of the ICM (bvvapec). Tables 1 and 2 summarizes the resul-
tant fit parameters. As shown in figure 2, the fit around FeXXV
Heα, particularly at thewline, improved significantly. The ve-
locity dispersion becomes slightly smaller, and the Fe abundance
becomes slightly larger than those with the original “1T” model,
although the change in velocity dispersion remains within the1σ
uncertainty. This behavior is consistent with the possibility that
resonant scattering is suppressing thewline in the Centaurus clus-
ter core.
3.1.2 Two-temperature approach
XRISM Collaboration et al. (2025a) reported that the Resolve
spectrum of the central1.5′×2.0′region in the sub-array anal-
ysis required two temperature components. We therefore added
an additional thermal component, expressed as follows:tbabs×
(bvvapec+bvvapec)(hereafter the Resolve “2T” model), and fit-
ted the Resolve full-array spectrum. The redshift, velocity disper-
sion, and abundance of each component were tied and treated as
free parameters. To model the FeXXVHeα wline in the same man-
ner as in the Resolve “1T w/ zgauss” fit, we also defined a model
of the formtbabs×(bvvapec+bvvapec+zgauss), referred to as
the “2T w/ zgauss” model. Note that this model includes only one
zgausscomponent to represent the FeXXVHeαresonance line.
Hereafter, we denote the two temperatures derived from both the
“2T” and “2T w/ zgauss” models askTandkT mid. The resultant
parameters of these two fits are listed in tables 1 and 2. As shown
in lower panels of figure 2, the “2T” model provides a better fit to
the S Heαlines and to the Fe Lyαlines, which show positive resid-
uals in the 1T fit. This improvement leads to the lower C-statistic
value obtained with the “2T” model. The “2T w/ zgauss” model
further improves the fit around the FeXXVHeαcomplex, partic-
ularly at the resonance line, and yields a lower C-statistic value.
The Fe abundance, bulk velocity, and velocity dispersion obtained
with the “2T w/ zgauss” model are close to those derived from the
“1T w/ zgauss” model. We further evaluated the models with the
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC; Akaike 1974) to compare their
goodness of fits. The AIC is defined asAIC i=−2ln(L i) + 2k i,
whereL iis the maximized likelihood function,k iis the number of
free parameters of modeli. The smaller the AIC value, the better
the model fits. By comparing the AIC values of “1T w/ zgauss”
model and “2T w/ zgauss” model,∆AIC = 190.37was deter-
mined. Similarly, by comparing “2T” model and “2T w/ zgauss”
model,∆AIC = 56.60was also calculated. Thus, “2T w/ zgauss”
model provides a superior description of the spectrum compared
with “1T w/ zgauss” model, and model “2T w/ zgauss” provides
a superior description compared with model “2T”. We also testedmodels with an additional temperature component, but the fits did
not improve, and the temperature of the new component could not
be constrained.
3.1.3 DEM approach
We also fitted a multi-temperature model with a differential emis-
sion measure (DEM) to the Resolve spectrum expressed astbabs×
(bvvgadem+zgauss), hereafter “gadem w/ zgauss”. In the
bvvgademmodel, the emission measure follows a Gaussian dis-
tribution characterized by a mean temperature,kT mean, and a stan-
dard deviation,σ kT. As in the “1T w/ zgauss” and “2T w/ zgauss”
models, we excluded the FeXXVHeα wline from AtomDB
and represented it using azgaussmodel (hereafter “gadem w/
zgauss”). The resultant fit parameters are listed in tables 1 and
2. The derived mean temperature is close to that from the “1T”
model, whileσ kTis comparable to the separation of the two tem-
peratures derived from the “2T w/ zgauss” model. The C-statistic
value, Fe abundance, bulk velocity, and velocity dispersion are
nearly identical to those of the “2T w/ zgauss” model. As shown
in lower panels of figure 2, the 2T andgademmodels had no sig-
nificant deviation in the residual distribution.
3.2 Joint analysis with XMM-Newton/RGS
3.2.1 Constraint of the cool component with the RGS spectra
Previous studies have reported the presence of an X-ray-emitting
component cooler than 1 keV in the Centaurus cluster core (e.g.,
Sanders et al. 2008; Takahashi et al. 2009; Fukushima et al. 2022).
The Resolve instrument has no sensitivity below the 2 keV band-
pass because the gate valve is closed and therefore cannot con-
strain the emission of such a cool gas component. We analyzed
the RGS data to assess this cool-phase gas and then incorporated
it into the Resolve spectral analysis. In this work, we adopted a2′-
width extraction region for RGS, which is smaller than the Resolve
FoV as shown in figure 1. Since the cooler component below 1
keV would be more centrally concentrated than the hot-phase ICM
(Pinto et al. 2015), the2′RGS extraction region should still con-
tain most of this compact cool component. In addition, widening
the RGS extraction region would degrade the effective spectral res-
olution and increase the contribution of the hotter gas, making it
less suitable for detecting the cool component. For these reasons,
we used the 2′-wide RGS data to constrain the low-temperature
component in the Resolve spectral modeling.
The RGS spectra were grouped so that each bin had at least
20 counts, and fitted by minimizing theχ2value. The first-
and second-order spectra of RGS were fitted in the 0.45–1.75
and 0.80–1.75 keV energy bands, respectively, as shown in fig-
ure 3. The RGS1 and RGS2 spectra, including both the first- and
second-order spectra, were fitted simultaneously. To account for
the spectral broadening caused by the spatial extent of the source,
we used thergsxsrcmodel in XSPEC with the MOS image in
the 0.45–2.0 keV band. We generated the background spectra
using the SAS toolrgsbkgmodeland subtracted them from the
source spectra. Similar to the spectral fits of the Resolve, the
RGS spectra were fitted with the two-temperature model, multi-
plied by an absorption model. The model formula is expressed
as follows:rgsxsrc×tbabs×(bvvapec+bvvapec)(“RGS 2T”
model). The velocity dispersion was fixed at120km s−1in the
“RGS 2T” model. We treated the Galactic hydrogen column den-
sityN Has a free parameter. The resultant parameters are shown in
tables 1 and 2. The RGS analysis provides two temperature com-
ponents, 1.9 and 0.8 keV . The higher-temperature component is

consistent withkT mid(∼1.6keV) found with the Resolve “2T w/
zgauss” model, implying that they represent the same phase gas.
The lower-temperature component (kT low) matched the interstellar
medium associated with NGC 4696 (Takahashi et al. 2009) and is
also consistent with the central temperature measured with XMM-
Newton (Sanders et al. 2016), supporting the assumption of the
localized cooler component.
We investigated the dependence of the derived temperatures
on the assumed velocity dispersion by fixing it at1000km s−1
or allowing it to vary freely. Both cases yielded consistent tem-
peratures with the value in table 1 within the statistical uncer-
tainties. To examine the impact of the RGS background sub-
traction method, we performed, in addition to the subtraction of
the RGS background spectrum, two alternative tests: (i) repre-
senting the RGS background spectrum by a simple power-law
component and (ii) modelling it with a more complex formula
(constant×(bknpow+gauss+gauss)). In all cases, the tem-
peratures derived from the “RGS 2T” model fits are consistent.We tested three configurations ofN Hin which it was fixed at
7.77×1020cm−2as adopted in the Resolve spectral fits, treated
as a free parameter, and fixed at1.22×1021cm−2(Willingale et
al. 2013). In all cases, the derived temperatures are consistent with
each other. The two-temperature model applied by Sanders et al.
(2008) yielded temperatures of1.85±0.02keV and0.766±0.008
keV which are in good agreement with our results. Like the tem-
peratures, the RGS and XRISM Fe abundances reported here are
also fairly consistent with each other, although we note more gen-
erally that the Fe abundances from the RGS analysis are sensitive
to many modelling assumptions (de Plaa et al. 2017; Fukushima et
al. 2022), and a similar analysis of the same RGS data in Mernier
et al. (2026) yields considerably different Fe abundances.
3.2.2 Impact on the spectral analysis for Resolve
Since thekT lowcomponent could not be constrained from the
Resolve spectral fits alone, we included the additionalkT lowcom-
ponent from the RGS analysis into the Resolve analysis. We
fixed the temperature of thekT lowcomponent and also fixed the
normalization ratio of thekT midtokT lowcomponents derived
from the RGS spectral fit. The model formula is represented as
tbabs×(bvvapec+bvvapec+bvvapec+zgauss)(Resolve “3T
w/ zgauss” model). Although the spatial extraction regions of RGS
and Resolve are not identical, we tested the effect of including the
RGS-derived low-temperature component using the RGS normal-
ization ratio as a trial assumption. The resultant parameters are
shown in tables 1 and 2. The parameters derived from the Resolve
“2T w/ zgauss” model are consistent with those from the “3T w/
zgauss” model.
We also applied the same approach as in the Resolve “3T w/
zgauss” model to the “gadem w/ zgauss” model. We added the
kTlowcomponents derived from the RGS analysis into the DEM
model. The model formula istbabs×(bvvgadem+bvvapec+
zgauss)(“gadem+1T w/ zgauss” model). The temperature of the
bvvapecmodel was fixed to thekT lowvalue from the RGS anal-
ysis. The resultant best-fit parameters are listed in tables 1 and 2.
The temperatures from the “gadem+1T w/ zgauss” model (with
kTlowcomponent) and the “gadem w/ zgauss” model (without
kTlowcomponent) are consistent with each other. Thus, thekT low
component would have no impact on the results of the Resolve
spectral fits above 2 keV , regardless of whether the main band is
reproduced by the two-temperature or DEM approach.
3.3 Line ratio diagnostics
As shown in figure 4, emission lines from Si to Ni are clearly
detected. While the continuum of the Resolve spectrum, whose
shape roughly represents the electron temperature, is well repre-
sented by both the “1T” and “2T” approaches, the “1T” model fails
to explain the intensities for several lines (see figure 2). Due to the
strong dependence of line emissivities on plasma temperature, de-
tailed diagnostics of observed line fluxes serve as a sensitive probe
of the temperature structure.
To measure the fluxes of the individual lines, we excluded those
listed in table 3 from thebvvapecmodel, and addedzgausscom-
ponents to the Resolve “1T w/ zgauss model”. The rest-frame
centroid energy of each line in table 3 was taken from AtomDB
3.1.3. Its redshift was tied to that of thebvvapecmodel and left
free to vary. We adopted the 1T model for this analysis because
it already reproduces the observed continuum well, and as shown
in figure 4, the continuum is accurately modeled after adding the
Gaussian components. Therefore, an additional temperature com-

ponent is unnecessary for the purpose of measuring individual line
fluxes. Emission lines not listed in table 3 remained included in
thebvvapecmodel. The abundance and velocity dispersion of
thebvvapecmodel were fixed to the numbers derived from the
Resolve “1T w/ zgauss” model. The temperature and normaliza-
tion of the model were left free. In the energy range of 5.4–9.0
keV , the energy scale uncertainty is±0.3eV (Eckart et al. 2025).
Allowing the redshift of each line to vary within this±0.3eV
range does not change the best-fit line widths or fluxes. Since the
Lyman-series doublets, with the exception of FeXXVILyα, were
not resolved spectrally, the line widths and flux ratios were tied to
the values of the corresponding Lyα 1, as shown in table 3. The
unresolved substructures of SXVHeβ, CaXIXHeβ, FeXXVHeγ,
and FeXXVHeδwere represented by a singlezgaussmodel. The
resultant normalization and line width of each line obtained by fit-
ting are shown in table 3.
Figure 5 shows the temperature dependence of line flux ratios in
a CIE plasma (theapecmodel). The excitation temperatures ob-
tained from the line ratios of different transitions of the same ions
(same in both the element and ionization state) are shown in the
upper part of figure 5. The ionization temperatures, which are the
line ratios of different ionization stages of the same elements, are
shown in the lower part of figure 5. The derived excitation temper-
atures from the observed line ratios, such as S Heβ/w, Fe Heβ 1/z,
and Fe Heγ/z, are broadly consistent with the temperature derived
from the Resolve “1T w/ zgauss” model. On the other hand, all the
measured ratios give tighter constraints on the ionization tempera-
tures.
Figure 6 summarizes the derived excitation and ionization tem-
peratures from the observed line ratios. Under a CIE plasma, the
excitation and ionization temperatures are expected to be the same.
Although the excitation temperatures are consistent with the tem-
perature derived from the Resolve “1T w/ zgauss” model, the ion-
ization temperatures show a systematic increase with atomic num-
bers. A similar trend has been reported for the Perseus cluster
observation with Hitomi (Hitomi Collaboration et al. 2018c), and
these indicate the existence of the multi-phase gas in the cluster
core.
Some of the galaxy clusters observed with XRISM/Resolve
observations exhibit FeXXVILyα 2/Lyα 1flux ratios that exceed
the value predicted by a CIE plasma model (A2029: XrismCollaboration et al. 2025b, Coma: Xrism Collaboration et
al. 2025c). In the Centaurus cluster, the measured FeXXVI
Lyα 2/Lyα 1flux ratio is consistent with the expected number for a
CIE plasma within the statistical uncertainty. Whether using only
the Lyα 1or the combined FeXXVILyα 1+Lyα 2flux, the ion-
ization temperatures inferred from the line flux ratios are different
from the resultant temperature derived from the Resolve “1T w/
zgauss” model, although only the FeXXVILyα 1is adopted in the
analysis of the line ratios in this paper.
Figure 7 shows the measured line ratio of FeXXVHeαreso-
nance (w) and forbidden (z). The observedw/zratio is smaller
than that expected from the isothermal CIE plasma model, sug-
gesting that thewline is suppressed by resonant scattering, as
reported in the central region of the Perseus cluster (Hitomi
Collaboration et al. 2018b).
3.4 Ion temperature measurements
As described in sections 3.1, 3.3, the CIE assumption seems to
hold in the ICM of the Centaurus cluster core. Here, we further test
this assumption by measuring the ion temperature and comparing
it to the electron temperature. Thanks to the high-resolution spec-
troscopy of Resolve, it is possible to directly and quantitatively es-
timate each component of the line broadening: the sum of a natural
width, the instrumental resolution of the detector, the turbulent gas
motion, and the thermal motion of ions. Since the natural width
is much smaller than the other components, the line broadening
is denoted asσ v+th=p
σ2v+σ2
th, whereσ vis broadening due to
turbulent gas motion andσ this broadening due to thermal motion
of ions.σ this expressed asσ th=p
kTion/m ion, whereT ionis the
ion temperature, andm ionis the ion mass. The line broadening
due to thermal motion of ions depends on the ion mass, while the
broadening due to turbulent gas motion is independent of the ion
mass.
We estimated the velocities using the emission lines listed in ta-
ble 3, but the following lines were excluded from the analysis: (i)
lines represent by a singlezgaussmodel for two lines, (ii) lines
for which only an upper limit on the line width was obtained, (iii)
Lyα 2, Lyβ 2, Heβ 2lines except for FeXXVILyα 2. The Siwandz
lines were excluded because the statistics were inadequate to use
them. As shown in the left panel of figure 8, the observed line

widths can be decomposed into the turbulent broadening (velocity
dispersion) and thermal broadening for each ion at a certain tem-

were derived from spectral fits using a thermal plasma model thatincludes the effect of the thermal broadening. Now we express
the sum of the turbulent and thermal broadenings as a single ve-
locity dispersion. Although the uncertainty in the full-width half

and±6km s−1, respectively, toσ v=120km s−1) smaller than our
statistical error of±7km s−1, they are dominated by uncertainty in
line broadening due to potential energy-scale misalignment across
the pixels. Aside from at 5.9 keV (where the energy scales are con-
trived to agree) and 6.5 keV (where the dispersion in energy-scale
errors across pixels was determined to be 0.2 eV , see Simionescu
et al. 2026), there is no available estimate for this potential broad-
ening. Therefore, we have used the recommended values for the
energy-scale uncertainty (±1eV below 5.4 keV and±0.3eV over
the range 5.4–8.0 keV , Eckart et al. 2025) as a conservative es-
timate of possible broadening due to energy scale misalignment
across the array. Since line broadening results in determination
of larger velocity dispersion, the associated velocity errors only
extend to values below the best-fit value. The quadrature sum of
statistical and systematic errors was taken into account in the fit
shown in figure 8, which shows the total velocity dispersion of the
sum of the turbulence (σ v) and thermal broadening (σ th). Sinceσ v
was assumed to be constant for all lines, the contribution of broad-
ening due to the thermal motion of ions is larger for elements with
smaller atomic numbers relative to the observed line width. Weexamined the correlation ofσ v+th=p

tron temperature from the Resolve “1T w/ zgauss” model.
4 Discussion
4.1 Origins of deviation from the 1T CIE plasma
As described in section 3.1, the observed Resolve spectrum is bet-
ter represented by the two-temperature or, more generally, multi-
temperature CIE plasma models than by the single-temperature
model. The line ratio diagnostics also indicate the possible pres-
ence of multi-temperature plasma in the central region of the
Centaurus cluster. Figure 9 shows a comparison of the observed
line flux ratios and the ratios predicted by the single-temperature,
two-temperature thermal plasma, andgademmodels. The line-
flux ratios of each element predicted by the two-temperature
plasma model show better agreement with the observations com-
pared to those from the single-temperature model. Thegadem

model also produces improved agreement in comparison to the
single-temperature case. Some observed line ratios, such as Ar
Lyβ1/Lyα 1and Ar Lyα 1/w, indicated a tendency to exceed or fall
below the predicted numbers of those models. To quantify these
differences, we calculated theχ2values between the observed line
flux ratios and those predicted by each model. The resultantχ2
values for the single-, two-, three-temperature CIE plasma, and
gademmodels compared to the observed ratios are 46.2, 4.3, 4.0,
and 6.4, respectively, for 16 degrees of freedom with no free pa-
rameters. Theseχ2values show that the two-temperature plasma
model best reproduces the observed line-flux ratios.
One plausible course for the deviation from a 1T plasma isthe projection effect, which occurs when the radial temperature
gradient from the center to the outskirts is integrated along the
line of sight. To examine this possibility, we used the three-
dimensional radial profiles of the temperature, density, and abun-
dance derived from Chandra observation data with the SPEXclus
model (Štofanová et al. 2025; see Majumder 2025; Mernier et al.
2026 for details of the analysis with the SPEXclusmodel). For
the outer region of the Centaurus cluster, we adopted the three-
dimensional radial profiles from the Suzaku analysis of Walker et
al. (2013). By integrating these three-dimensional radial profiles
along the line of sight, we calculated the line flux ratios, which are
shown as the orange x-shaped markers (“projection”) in figure 9.
The projection model yields aχ2value of 11.4. The resultantχ2
value is significantly smaller than that predicted by the 1T model.
Although theχ2value from the projection model is higher than
those predicted by the 2T and gadem models, the observed line
flux ratios, especially for Fe, are well represented by the projection
model. On the other hand, a slight residual is observed in the S line
ratio. This may be caused by uncertainties in the projection model
based on the Fe reference from Chandra observations, and/or by
the influence of the low-temperature component indicated by the
RGS analysis as described in section 3.2.1. When the S Lyα 1/w,
Lyα 1/Heβline ratios were excluded, theχ2value for the projec-
tion modelχ2value was 4.7 for 14 degrees of freedom, consistent
with those predicted by the 2T and gadem models. Therefore, we
concluded that the projection effect adequately explains the obser-
vational results with XRISM/Resolve.
The projection effect also reasonably explains the tendency for
elements with lower atomic numbers to have lower ionization tem-
peratures. In addition, the line widths of emission lines from
the lighter elements tend to be broader than those from the heav-
ier ones as described in section 3.4, since the emission-measure
weighted average fluxes of the lines from the lighter elements
should be biased to the cool gas in the line of sight, which is con-
firmed by the RGS observation. Therefore, the observed line ra-
tios from the Resolve observations are consistent with the previous
Chandra and XMM-Newton observations.
4.2 Comparison with Previous Observations of Other
Galaxy Clusters
Hitomi Collaboration et al. (2018c) compared the observed and
model-predicted Fe line ratios, which provide excitation temper-
atures, in the core of the Perseus cluster. In this study, we com-
pared not only the Fe ratios but also the line ratios of Si, S, and
Ar, which also provide excitation temperatures. As shown in fig-
ure 9, the observed Fe line ratios, which are used to derive the
ionization temperature, tend to be higher than those predicted by
the single-temperature CIE model. This trend is consistent with
that observed in the Perseus cluster (Hitomi Collaboration et al.
2018c). Hitomi Collaboration et al. (2018c) reported that the ob-
served Fe Lyα/z, Fe Lyα/Heβ, and Fe Lyα/Heγratios were higher
than those predicted by the two-temperature CIE plasma model. In
contrast, in this work, the observed Fe Lyα 1/z, Fe Lyα 1/Heβ 1, and
Fe Lyα 1/Heγratios show good agreement with the 2T CIE model
predictions.
Sarkar et al. (2025) performed temperature measurements for
Abell 2029 using line diagnostics based on various Fe lines. Since
the ICM in Abell 2029 is hotter than that in the Centaurus clus-
ter, the Fe emission lines are stronger. In the central and north-
ern regions, they resolved the cooler gas component lower than
the temperature derived from the single-temperature CIE model.

They interpreted this as evidence for the presence of multi-phase
gas. In the pointing located further to the north, The tempera-
tures from the line ratios were consistent with the values predicted
by the single-temperature CIE model. For the Centaurus cluster
as well, it is possible that in the outer regions the temperatures
derived from line diagnostics agree with those predicted by thesingle-temperature CIE model.
For the Perseus cluster observation (Hitomi Collaboration et al.
2018c), bothσ vandkT ionwere set as free parameters to derive
the ion temperature. On the other hand, for the Centaurus cluster,
when bothσ vandkT ionwere allowed to vary freely, the best-fit
value ofσ vbecame significantly smaller than that obtained from
the Resolve “1T w/ zgauss” model. Therefore, we fixedσ vand
allowed onlykT ionto vary (section 3.4). Due to its lower temper-
ature compared with the Perseus cluster, we expect that the un-
certainty in the velocity dispersion,σ v, in the Centaurus cluster
is large. Since thermal broadening contributes only a small frac-
tion to the total line width, the thermal and turbulent components
cannot be separated.
4.3 Resonant Scattering
The effect of resonant scattering is most prominently seen in
the FeXXVHeαresonance line, which is the strongest line
in the Resolve spectrum. Following the procedure of Hitomi
Collaboration et al. (2018b), we calculated the optical depth
based on the Chandra data analysis with the SPEXclusmodel
(Majumder 2025), and the results are shown in figure 10. Under
the assumption of a velocity dispersion of 100 km s−1, the optical
depth of the FeXXVHeαresonance line reaches∼0.7within 1
arcmin from the cluster center. Therefore, resonant scattering can
be diagnosed by deviations of the observed FeXXVw/zratio from
the CIE prediction.
As demonstrated in section 3.3, the observedw/zratio of
2.1+0.3
−0.2 is lower than the values expected by any of the isothermal
CIE models used for comparison. At the temperature of2.39+0.02
−0.02
keV derived from the Resolve “1T w/ zgauss” model, the predicted
intrinsicw/zratio is about2.6. The multi-temperature “projec-
tion” model also yields a similar value of∼2.5. If the deficit is
interpreted as the result of resonant scattering, the FeXXVHeα w
line is suppressed by approximately20%. Although the difference
between the observed and predictedw/zratios from the isother-
mal CIE prediction is within2σ-level significance, it provides a
hint of resonant scattering in the central region of the Centaurus
cluster.

Resonance scattering not only suppresses spectral lines at op-
tical depths≥1, but also appears to enhance the wings of these
spectral line profiles when attempting to describe them using a
Gaussian model under conditions of limited energy resolution and
insufficient statistics (Hitomi Collaboration et al. 2018b). The ob-
served line width was larger for FeXXVHeα wthanz, where the
difference was about2σ(table 3). As noted in section 3.4, the
observed line width of each emission line involves systematic un-
certainties due to the uncertainty in the FWHM of the instrumen-
tal line-spread function. With this systematic uncertainty, the ob-
served width of the FeXXVHeα wline remains larger than the
width of thezline. Although other possibilities, such as a charge
exchange effect, recombining plasma, or the uncertainties in the
atomic excitations in Hitomi Collaboration et al. (2018b) could
not be entirely ruled out, the resonant scattering provides the most
plausible explanation for these observational results, namely the
w/zline ratio and the broader line width of thewline. The ob-
served Fewline suppression is consistent with the turbulent mo-
tions inferred from the line broadening, and hence the motions are
consistent with being isotropic. This indicates that the line broad-
ening is driven by small scale motions rather than a superposition
of bulk flow in the line of sight. Consequently, we found the in-
dication of resonant scattering in the Centaurus cluster core; the
significance was approximately at the 2σlevel.
5 Summary and Conclusion
We found the temperature structure of the Centaurus cluster core
with XRISM/Resolve. In the spectral analysis in the 1.8–12 keV
energy band, the two-temperature and DEM models better repre-
sented the observed spectrum of the cluster core than the isother-
mal model. Even if the cool component (kT <1 keV) derived from
the XMM-Newton/RGS analysis is added in the spectral model,
the resultant parameters of the Resolve spectral analysis are not
affected. We performed line diagnostics using the line flux ratios
of Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe to determine the excitation and ioniza-tion temperatures. The excitation temperatures derived from the
line ratios other than Ar Lyβ 1/Lyα 1agree with the derived tem-
perature from the Resolve “1T w/ zgauss” model. On the other
hand, the resultant ionization temperatures revealed the deviation
from the 1T CIE plasma model. The derived ionization temper-
ature from the line flux ratios exhibited a tendency to increase in
proportion to the atomic mass. A similar trend was reported in the
central region of the Perseus cluster observed with Hitomi/SXS.
As a result, the derived temperature from the Resolve observation
above 2 keV indicates the multi-temperature gas, and the tempera-
ture structure of the Centaurus cluster core can be simply explained
by the projection effect. The observed FeXXVw/zratio was lower
than the value predicted by a CIE plasma model. Compared with
the isothermal CIE plasma model, the Fewline was suppressed
by approximately 20%, and the line width was broader than that
of the Fezline. These results suggest the presence of resonance
scattering in the core of the Centaurus cluster, with a significance
of approximately 2σlevel.

Appendix 1 Details of the Resolve spectral
analysis
Figure 11 shows the wide-band spectral fits and their residuals with
the Resolve “2T w/ zgauss” and “3T w/ zgauss” models in the
1.8–12 keV band. The lower temperature component below 1 keV
derived from the XMM-Newton/RGS analysis was negligible for
the Resovle spectral fit analysis above 2 keV . Figures 12 and 13
show the resultant fits and their residuals around H- and He-like
emission lines from each element. Resultant parameters for each
line are shown in table 3.
Appendix 2 Comparison of the projected line
ratios between AtomDB and the SPEX
The projected line ratio models derived from theclusmodel based
on the Chandra and Suzaku observations represent the observed
line ratios as described in section 4.1. We compared the line ratios
derived from the AtomDB and the SPEX, although theclusmodel
was developed based on SPEX. Figure 14 shows a comparison of
the predicted line ratios derived from the AtomDB and SPEX, and
the observed line ratio is the same as those in figure 9. These two
profiles are generally consistent with each other, although slight
differences are seen between AtomDB and SPEXACT in the line
flux ratios of the S and Fe lines.

Fig. 13.Same as figure 12, but for He-like emission lines from each element. Alt text: Eight line graphs. In the upper panel of each graph, the y-axis
shows the count rate per second per kilo–electron volt. In the lower panel of each graph, the y-axis shows the residuals between the data and the model.
The x-axis in all panels shows the energy.

Fig. 14.Comparisons between the observed line flux ratios and the pre-
dicted ratios by the AtomDB and SPEX. Black crosses show the observed
line ratios. The orange x-shaped and gray square markers correspond
to the predictions from the projection model based on the AtomDB 3.1.3
and SPEXACT 3.08.01. The bottom panel shows the ratio of observed to
model-predicted line ratios. Vertical dotted line separates the ratios cor-
responding to the excitation temperatures and those corresponding to the
ionization temperatures. Alt text: One graph. The y-axis of the top panel
shows the line flux ratio. The y-axis of the bottom panel shows the residu-
als between the data and the models.
