ABSTRACT
Context.Kink oscillation frequency is a key parameter for coronal seismology. It is still unclear how gravitational stratification affects
the kink frequency in curved coronal loops.
Aims.This work aims to investigate the effect of gravitational stratification on the frequency of kink oscillations in curved coronal
loops and discuss their seismological potential.
Methods.We conduct numerical computations within the ideal MHD framework to study different kink polarizations and harmonics
in a curved, gravitationally stratified coronal loop. The oscillation frequencies derived from the Lagrangian displacement are compared
with the WKB approximation.
Results.For the vertically polarized fundamental mode, the oscillation frequency deviates from the WKB approximation by about
18% in the current numerical setup. Nevertheless, the oscillation frequency closely matches the local Alfvén frequency near the loop
apex. On the other hand, the frequency of the horizontally polarized fundamental mode exhibits only a 7% deviation in our current
model from the WKB approximation and closely matches the local Alfvén frequency near one quarter of the loop. For the first
overtones, the frequencies for both polarizations can be well described by the WKB approximation.
Conclusions.The frequency of vertically polarized fundamental kink modes can be predicted by the local Alfvén frequency near
the loop apex. In contrast, the WKB approximation remains highly reliable for estimating the frequency of horizontally polarized
fundamental modes and first overtones, which is also well described by the local Alfvén frequency near one quarter of the loop. These
results therefore pave the way for spatially dependent coronal seismology, enabling, e.g., the probing of magnetic field strength at
different locations along a coronal loop.

1. Introduction
By combining magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave theory with
observations, coronal seismology provides inversion schemes to
indirectly infer some physical parameters, such as the coronal
magnetic field (see, e.g., Nakariakov & Kolotkov 2020, for a re-
cent review). As the only MHD wave mode that can disturb the
axis of magnetic structures, kink waves can be used to diagnose
the coronal magnetic field based on their measured frequencies
regardless of standing or propagating waves (e.g., Nakariakov
& Ofman 2001; Yang et al. 2020a,b, 2024). However, current
seismology schemes are still based on the theoretical framework
of kink modes in canonical magnetic cylinders (e.g., Zajtsev &
Stepanov 1975; Edwin & Roberts 1983). Gravity and curvature
of coronal loops are essential, but have not yet been taken into
account simultaneously in the context of coronal seismology.
As a typical magnetic structure in the solar corona, curved
loops are known to be typical waveguides for kink waves (e.g.,
Reale 2014; Nakariakov & Kolotkov 2020). The influence of
loop curvature on kink modes was initially explored in two-
dimensional (2D) models (e.g., Smith et al. 1997; Brady & Ar-
ber 2005; Selwa et al. 2005; Verwichte et al. 2006a,b,c). These
studies were restricted to the examination of vertical polariza-
tions, which can be excited, for example, by slow modes in short
loops (Lopin & Nagorny 2024) or vortex shedding (Karampelas& Van Doorsselaere 2021). Although vertical polarizations have
also been confirmed in observations (e.g., Wang & Solanki 2004;
Wang et al. 2008), the other polarization, namely the more fre-
quently observed horizontal kink polarization (e.g., Zhong et al.
2023), should also be examined. Analytically, Van Doorsselaere
et al. (2004, 2009) found that the curvature in a toroidal loop
model has little influence on kink eigenmodes under a force-free
magnetic field. Numerically, the frequency difference between
horizontally and vertically polarized kink oscillations has been
found not to be observable in a semi-torus model (Terradas et al.
2006). Considering the WKB approximation, Magyar & Nakari-
akov (2020) showed that the analytical prediction can reasonably
describe the kink frequency in their planar model. More recently,
Guo et al. (2024) examined the oscillation and damping prop-
erties for both horizontal and vertical polarizations, comparing
their results with previous studies of different kink polarizations
(Ruderman 2009; Guo et al. 2020). However, these studies on
kink oscillations in curved loop models do not consider the ef-
fect of gravitational stratification.
In long coronal loops whose lengths significantly exceed the
gravitational scale height, gravitational stratification is expected
to influence loop dynamics. Density stratification affects the dis-
placements of fundamental kink modes in coronal loops (e.g.,
Erdélyi & Verth 2007). Andries et al. (2005b) analytically in-

vestigated the influence of longitudinal density stratification on
the frequencies and damping rates of kink eigenmodes. Further-
more, based on deviations of the period ratio between the fun-
damental mode and the first overtone (i.e.,P 1/P2) from 2, the
density stratification can be determined (Andries et al. 2005a;
Van Doorsselaere et al. 2007). However, magnetic stratification
induced loop expansion can increaseP 1/P2and thus signifi-
cantly affect the results of coronal seismology (Verth & Erdélyi
2008). Regarding the propagation of kink modes, the effect of
gravitational stratification was analytically investigated by Spruit
(1981), who introduced a global cutoff. Although Lopin et al.
(2014) offered a different perspective of the cutofffor kink waves
in a stratified atmosphere, recent numerical work by Pelouze
et al. (2023) has helped to clarify the physical scenario. In re-
cent numerical studies of kink oscillations in magnetic cylinders,
gravity is routinely included in the contexts of both seismology
(e.g., Gao et al. 2024, 2025) and coronal heating (e.g., Karam-
pelas et al. 2019). However, none of these studies of kink waves
in stratified loops have simultaneously incorporated the effects
of loop curvature.
The combined effects of gravity and loop curvature on kink
oscillations have not yet been investigated in the same model. In
the current work, we examine kink eigenmodes in a curved coro-
nal loop with the presence of gravity. This paper is organized as
follows. Section 2 describes the equilibrium and the numerical
setup. The simulation results are presented and discussed in Sec-
tion 3 and Section 4, followed by a summary of the present work
in Section 5.
2. Model Description
We considered a potential magnetic field similar to that in Guo
et al. (2024). In Cartesian coordinate system (x,y,z), the initial
magnetic field is given by
Bx(x,z)=B 0cos x
ΛB!

whereB 0=30G,Λ B=2L B/πwithL B=145Mm. We also
define a set of orthonormal basis vectors ( ˆet,ˆeh,ˆev),
ˆet=cos(x/Λ B) ˆx−sin(x/Λ B)ˆz,
ˆeh=ˆy,
ˆev=sin(x/Λ B) ˆx+cos(x/Λ B)ˆz.(2)
In thex−zplane, ˆet(ˆev) is locally parallel (perpendicular) to the
magnetic field.
We then consider a vertically stratified atmosphere. The
gravity is given by
g(z)=−g⊙R2
⊙
(z+R⊙)2ˆz,(3)
whereg⊙is the gravitational acceleration on the solar surface,
R⊙is the solar radius. The stratified background pressure and
density are described by
dp(z)
dz=−g⊙R2

(z+R⊙)2ρ(z).(4)
Note that the background temperature is constant. Combined
with the ideal gas law, we can readily obtain the density andpressure of the background

whereA 0=2k B/mH,Te=2MK,ρ e0=4.18×10−16g cm−3.
The density-enhanced loop is then constructed. The internal
loop density and pressure profiles at a given heightzare

loop at its footpoints. The parameterb=10 determines the width
of the boundary layer. Note that the density enhanced loop is in
a low-βenvironment with a maximum plasmaβof 0.016. The
3D view of the initial state is shown in Figure 1a.
Before proceeding, we need to specify our numerical setup.
Regarding the bottom boundary atz=0, all the components of
the velocity are set to vanish, while all the components of the
magnetic field follow the zero gradient condition. The density
and pressure are fixed at their initial values. Outflow boundary
conditions are applied to all the other side boundaries. To ensure
the stability of the computation, we also consider a velocity ab-
sorption layer (see also Pelouze et al. 2023; Guo et al. 2023; Gao
et al. 2024). The velocity is modified by
v′(x,y,z;t)=α(t)γ(z)v(x,y,z;t),(13)

witht c=2000s andl 0=1Mm being the unit of length. We
then solve the set of ideal 3D MHD equations with the PLUTO

code (Mignone et al. 2007). As in Guo et al. (2024), a similar
magnetic field splitting method is used. We choose the piecewise
parabolic scheme for spatial reconstruction, the HLLD Riemann
solver to calculate the numerical fluxes, and the second-order
Runge–Kutta method for time marching. The computational do-
main is [−120,120]×[−15,15]×[0,100]Mm. We adopt a set of
uniform grid with 600×120×400 cells.
Note that relaxation is necessary, as it is not a magnetostatic
balance system so far. The system reaches equilibrium after a
relaxation period of 2000s, and the relaxed state is shown in
Figure 1b. In the following, we consider this relaxed state as
t=0. The maximum residual velocity in the system is less than
2km/s. Since the characteristic evolution timescale of the sys-
tem,|δρ/∇·(ρv)|, is much longer than the period of the wave
of interest, the system can thus be regarded as a stable state.
Then we specify the initial perturbations. We distinguish two
different polarizations, namely horizontal and vertical. As dis-
cussed in Guo et al. (2024), the density distribution across the
loop cross-section is no longer axisymmetric due to gravity in-
duced stratification. Since the density remains nearly constant in
the horizontal direction at a given height, horizontally polarized
modes experience little influence from stratification. In contrast,
vertically polarized kink modes are expected to be more strongly
affected by gravitational stratification. In the following, we first
focus on vertical polarization. Similar to the initial conditions in
Guo et al. (2024), we introduce an initial velocity perturbation
of the form

apex and zero velocity at loop footpoints. For reference, we also

3. Results
We first examine the frequency of the vertical polarization. To
better compare the results with analytical predictions, we track
the Lagrangian displacement of a fluid parcel. This is imple-
mented by assigning passive tracer in the code. As such, we
can follow the displacement of a fluid parcel within the loop re-
gion. The solid lines in Figure 2 show the temporal evolution
of the Lagrangian velocity of the specified fluid parcels. Dif-
ferent fluid parcels in the loop are sampled, as distinguished
by different colors. One fluid parcel is initially located at the
loop apex ([x,y,z]=[0,0,70] Mm) att=0, the other two
fluid parcels are initially located at one quarter position of the
loop ([x,y,z]=[59.4,0,49.4]Mm) and the opposite quarter of
the loop ([x,y,z]=[−59.4,0,49.4]Mm). Following a procedure
similar to that in Guo et al. (2020, 2024), we estimate the oscilla-
tion period as twice the average time interval between two adja-
cent extrema of the oscillating profile. For the loop apex (black
solid curve), this procedure yields a period ofPfun
v=221.6s,
while the oscillation period at the other two quarters of the loop
is 226s. Neglecting the small measurement errors at different lo-
cations, we find that the periods are similar. We also find that
these oscillation profiles are in phase, and that the two quarters of
the loop exhibit the same oscillation behaviour. This clearly indi-
cates that the excited oscillation in the current loop corresponds
to the fundamental mode. To be consistent with observations, we
use the period at the loop apex to represent the oscillation period
in the loop hereafter.

Under some assumptions in a straight magnetic cylinder,
such as the thin-tube-thin-boundary (TTTB) approximation, the
period can be predicted through modal analysis (e.g., Edwin &
Roberts 1983; Goossens et al. 1992). When the Alfvén frequency
varies along the loop axis, the oscillation frequency can be es-
timated using the WKB approximation. For loops with an ax-
isymmetric density profile across the loop, the WKB approxima-
tion can describe the oscillation frequency quite well (Guo et al.
2024). In the current model, applying the WKB approximation
yields a predicted period

wherec kis the kink speed,v Aiis the internal Alfvén speed along
the loop axis,Lrepresents the loop length,sis the distance from
a footpoint along the loop axis and can be expressed as a function
ofz, andB(s) is the magnetic field strength alongs. According
to this formula, we thus obtain a period ofP WKB =188.3 s.
Therefore, the oscillation periodP vdeviates from this theoretical
estimation (P WKB) by approximately 18%.
In general, the Lagrangian velocity is expected to be different
from the Eulerian velocity measured at a fixed position. How-
ever, in the current case, Figure 2 shows that the Lagrangian
velocity closely matches the velocity measured at the fixed po-
sitions (filled black circles in Figure 2). This agreement can be
understood by calculating the Lagrangian displacement from the
perturbation amplitude and oscillation period. The resulting dis-
placement is still smaller than the cross-sectional radius at the
loop apex, confirming that the traced fluid parcel remains within
the internal loop region with uniform velocity. In the following
analysis, we focus on the Lagrangian velocity only.
Figure 3 shows horizontal oscillation profiles similar to those
in Figure 2. We can also compute the oscillation period from the
different positions of the loop. At the apex (one quarter) of the
loop, the period is measured asPfun
h=174.8 s (178 s). The sim-
ilar periods, as well as the in phase property of different posi-
tions again indicates that the excited horizontal oscillation in the
current loop is an axial fundamental mode. We use the period
at the loop apex to represent the oscillation period. Therefore,
the oscillation period of the horizontal polarization deviates from
PWKB by only 7%.
We also examine the oscillation profiles of the first over-
tones. As for the fundamental modes, we consider both verti-
cal and horizontal polarizations of the first overtones. Oscilla-
tion profiles at the loop apex, as well as at one quarter and the
opposite quarter of the loop are presented in Figures 4 and 5. As
expected for the first overtones, the oscillation at one quarter of

the loop is in antiphase with that at the opposite quarter. The ve-
locity at the loop apex is nearly zero, indicating that this location
corresponds to a wave node. Before proceeding, we estimate the
predicted period of the first overtones, which is half that of the
fundamental modes, namely 94.15 s. To determine the oscilla-
tion periods from the numerical results, the same procedure de-
scribed in Figure 2 is applied to the oscillation profiles here. We
find that the oscillation period for the vertically polarized mode
isP1st
v=95.4 s, while that for the horizontally polarized mode
isP1st
h=90.3 s. Both values closely match the predicted period,
with a maximum deviation of about 4%.
The damping of the oscillation profiles can also be observed.
It is widely accepted that resonant absorption is the dominant
damping mechanism of kink oscillations (e.g., Goossens et al.
2002; Guo et al. 2024). However, resolving the resonant process
within the boundary layer surrounding the loop requires a higher
numerical resolution. Therefore, the damping process presented
here may not be reliable. Nevertheless, in the present work, we
mainly focus on the periods of different polarizations and har-
monics, which are not significantly influenced by numerical res-
olutions.
In addition, we note that the oscillation profiles in Figure 3
and Figure 5 are not as sinusoidal as those in the other figures,
showing some reverse steepening. This may result from the ex-
citation of higher harmonics of the kink oscillations. However, a
detailed examination is beyond the scope of the current work.
We further examine the distribution of the local Alfvén fre-
quency to gain insight into the oscillation period. Having the
Alfvén speed distribution at hand, we can calculate the local
Alfvén frequency distributionω A(x,z). For axial fundamental
modes and the first overtones, we have
ωfun

and

whereLis the length of the field line anchored at bottom
boundary, threading a given point (x,z). Figure 6 shows the lo-
cal Alfvén frequency distribution on the surfacey=0. We alsotranslate the periods of different kink polarizations to frequen-
cies for both the fundamental modes and the first overtones. In
Figure 6 (a), the local Alfvén frequency distribution for the fun-
damental modes is illustrated. The frequency of the vertically
polarized kink mode matches the local Alfvén frequency near
the loop apex, as shown by the dashed black line. This sug-
gests that we can use the local Alfvén frequency near the apex
to predict the real oscillation frequency of the vertically polar-
ized fundamental modes. When we move downward along the
loop, the local Alfvén frequency increases. Near one quarter of
the loop, the local frequency becomes comparable to both the
value calculated from the WKB approximationP WKB and the
measured periodPfun
hof the horizontally polarized fundamental
mode (dash-dotted line). As aforementioned, WKB theory can
describe the frequency of horizontal modes quite well, as pre-
viously confirmed by Guo et al. (2024). Figure 6 (b) shows the
local Alfvén frequency distribution for the first overtones. We
also overplot the frequencies of both the vertically and horizon-
tally polarized first overtones. Since the periods of the two polar-
izations are similar and closely match the WKB prediction, the
frequencies for both polarizations can also be described by local
Alfvén frequency near one quarter of the loop.
Furthermore, we can also see the dashed lines outside the
loop region in Figure 6. This leads to the wave tunneling effect
and results in lateral leakage of the wave. This scenario has been
discussed in Guo et al. (2024).
4. Discussion
4.1. Frequency deviations from WKB theory
To understand the deviation of the oscillation frequency from
the WKB approximation, we should revisit the local Alfvén fre-
quency. For kink modes, the oscillation frequency is determined
by contributions from both the internal and external loop re-
gions. As shown in Figure 6, the local Alfvén frequency de-
creases along the ˆe vdirection (perpendicular to the magnetic
field lines). Therefore, for the vertically polarized kink mode,
regions with both higher and lower frequencies than that inside
the loop become relevant. For vertically polarized fundamental
modes, the damping of the oscillation (see Figure 2) leads to
an unequal contribution from the lower and upper loop regions.
Given that the realistic oscillation is typically excited below the
loop (e.g., Zimovets & Nakariakov 2015), leading to an initial
upward motion, the upper loop region contributes more frac-
tions. As a result, the measured oscillation frequency is lower
than the WKB prediction. This is also consistent with previ-
ous results in Guo et al. (2024) when a uniform density loop
is considered. In the current case, the deviation from the WKB
approximation is larger. This is because gravitational stratifi-
cation enhances the non-uniformity of the loop along its axis.
Consequently, a steeper gradient develops in the local Alfvén
frequency, which introduces greater uncertainty into the WKB
approximation. For vertically polarized first overtones, the an-
tiphase oscillation with respect to the apex decreases the above
effect. Therefore, the deviations of the vertically polarized first
overtones from the WKB approximation are quite small. In the
horizontal case, the loop oscillates in the ˆe hdirection of almost
uniform local Alfvén frequencies, allowing the WKB approxi-
mation to predict the oscillation frequency with a smaller devia-
tion.
The frequency of the vertically polarized fundamental mode
matches the local Alfvén frequency near the loop apex. In prin-
ciple, the frequency calculated from the WKB approximation

lines represent contours of the frequencies corresponding to the vertical (horizontal) polarizations as labelled.
should correspond to the local Alfvén frequency at some loca-
tion in the loop region, as indicated by Eq. (20) and illustrated
in Figure 6. In the current model, as discussed above, the mea-
sured frequency is lower than the WKB prediction, meaning that
the oscillation frequency is shifted toward the loop apex. This is
not coincidental, but rather a natural consequence of vertically
polarized fundamental modes in the current model.
4.2. Implications for magnetic field measurements
The oscillation frequency serves as a key observable of kink
modes in coronal loops. However, in seismology processes
in stratified coronal loops, it should be emphasized that even
when using a WKB approximation that incorporates axial non-
uniformity (as in Section 3), the inversion process inherently re-
tains a degree of uncertainty. In the case of horizontally polarized
kink modes, this uncertainty remains acceptable, given that the
observed oscillation frequency deviates from the WKB predic-
tion by only about 5%. However, seismological application for
vertically polarized kink modes requires greater caution when
based solely on the WKB theory. In realistic gravitationally strat-
ified loops, axial non-uniformity may lead to significant devia-
tions in oscillation frequency. Nevertheless, we suggest that one
should consider the local Alfvén frequency near the loop apex in
potential seismology applications when the vertical kink polar-
ization is involved to avoid large uncertainties.
The present results pave the way for spatially dependent in-
ference of the coronal magnetic field strength. In coronal seis-
mology, the magnetic field strength can be inferred from the
kink speed, provided that the phase speed and density are known
(e.g., Yang et al. 2020a,b, 2024). In the current scenario, as
discussed above, the measured periods of different fundamen-
tal polarizations reveal different local Alfvén frequencies. This
provides a potential approach to probe the local magnetic field
strength once the local density is determined. During the TRACE
era, Wang et al. (2008) reported that different kink polarizations
could coexist within the same coronal loop. However, unambigu-
ous observation of kink polarizations has only become possible
in recent years with multi-angle and high-resolution observa-
tions (e.g., Zhong et al. 2023). In addition, higher temporal reso-

doted lines illustrate the function of exp(−z/60) and exp(−z/70), respec-
tively.
lution observations may further help to distinguish the different
periods associated with different polarizations.
4.3. Scale height diagnostics
It has been known that deviations of the period ratioP 1/P2(i.e.,
Pfun/P1stin the present context) from 2 can be used to diagnose
the density scale height in a stratified atmosphere (e.g., Andries
et al. 2005a; Van Doorsselaere et al. 2007). In our computa-
tions, in principle, the density scale height can be inferred since
we have obtained the period ratioPfun/P1stfor different polar-
izations. Before proceeding, we first examine the initial density
distribution along the loop axis. As shown in Figure 7, the den-
sity profile does not follow an exact exponential form, but still
lies between two exponential functions, namely exp(−z/60) and
exp(−z/70). This indicates that the density distribution is close
to exponential, with a scale height between 60 Mm and 70 Mm.

man (2006), we consider solving the Sturm-Liouville problem
−d2u(s)
dz2=ω2
c2
k(s)u(s),u(s)=0 ats=0,L.(24)
The procedure is to provide the nonuniform distribution ofc k(s)
and then find the eigenvaluesω2. In Andries et al. (2005a), a
uniform magnetic field is assumed, so the kink speedc kis
ck(s)=s
2B2
0
µ0ρ(s)(1+ρ ie),(25)
whereρ ie =2 is the density ratio,ρ(s)=
ρ0exp[−L/πHsin(πs/L)]. Then the period ratioPfun/P1st
as a function ofL/πHpresented in Andries et al. (2005a) can
be reproduced, as shown by the blue line in Figure 8. However,
the magnetic field inhomogeneity in our current model has not
been included. We then take the variation of the magnetic field
strength, namelyB 0exp[−L/πΛ Bsin(πs/L) ], into account, and
obtain anotherPfun/P1stversusL/πHcurve, shown by the black
line in Figure 8. The difference between these two curves caused
by the nonuniform magnetic field is evident, and thePfun/P1st
even exceeds 2 in the black line whenL/πHis small.
The period ratio exceeding 2 seems consistent with the re-
sults of Verth & Erdélyi (2008), who showed that loop expan-
sion can increase the period ratio. In the current model, the loop
radius is kept constant in they-direction but varies in the ˆe vdirec-
tion perpendicular to the magnetic field lines. As a result, only
vertically polarized modes can feel the cross-sectional expansion
from the footpoints to the loop apex. Consequently, the increase
in radius in the ˆe v-direction leads to a period ratio of the vertical
polarizations greater than 2.
We then proceed to infer the density scale height. For the hor-
izontally polarized case, we compute the period ratio between
the fundamental mode and the first overtone asPfun
h/P1st
h=1.94.
This period ratio corresponds to a scale height of approximately
40Mm in our results, but exceeds 200Mm according to the curveof Andries et al. (2005a), which is significantly larger than the
actual scale height (60–70Mm) of the model. This indicates that
magnetic field inhomogeneity should be included in this inver-
sion scheme. However, if we instead use the period ratio between
the vertically polarized fundamental mode and the first overtone,
namelyPfun
v/P1st
v=2.35, the scale height can not be derived be-
cause this value falls outside the range shown in Figure 8.
5. Summary
We investigate the response of a gravitationally stratified coronal
loop to different initial velocity perturbations. For the vertically
polarized fundamental mode, the oscillation frequency deviates
from the WKB approximation by approximately 18%. Neverthe-
less, the measured oscillation frequency aligns closely with the
local Alfvén frequency near the loop apex. For the horizontally
polarized fundamental mode, the oscillation frequency is well
reproduced by the WKB theory, with a deviation of only 7%.
Moreover, the frequency closely matches local Alfvén frequency
near one quarter of the loop. These results suggest that the local
Alfvén frequency at the apex (quarter) of the loop can serve as a
more accurate prediction of the frequency of vertically (horizon-
tally) polarized fundamental kink oscillations in gravitationally
stratified coronal loops. For the first overtones, the oscillation
frequencies for both polarizations are close to the WKB approx-
imation, and their frequencies are closely match the local Alfvén
frequency close to one quarter of the loop.
Our findings open the possibility for spatially seismological
inference of the coronal magnetic field. The measured periods
of fundamental oscillations for different polarizations provide
the corresponding local Alfvén frequencies and, consequently,
could enable the probing of the magnetic field strength at multi-
ple locations along the loop, provided that the local density can
be obtained in observations.
In addition, the deviation of the period ratio between the fun-
damental mode and the first overtone, namelyPfun/P1st, can be
used to probe the density scale height in a stratified atmosphere.
By comparison with the results of Andries et al. (2005a), we find
that magnetic field inhomogeneity should be taken into account
to obtain a more accurate estimate of the scale height.
