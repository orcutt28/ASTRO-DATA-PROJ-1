ABSTRACT
The catalog of Gravitational Wave (GW) events is rapidly growing, providing key insights into the
evolution of massive binaries and compact object formation. However, a key challenge is to explain
the origin of exceptional events such as GW190814, among the most asymmetric mass-ratio mergers
to date (q≈0.1). We show that it shares an evolutionary pathway with the most unequal mass
Galactic High Mass X-ray Binary (HMXB) 4U 1700-37/ HD 153919. We demonstrate this unique
connection by utilizing a rich set of existing observational constraints for the HMXB and compute
detailed binary evolution models to explain its formation history. We find that conservative mass
transfer, along with a directed natal kick are essential to explain its current state. We show that this
system is unlikely to form a GW source due to a failed Common Envelope (CE) phase in the future,
in agreement with previous work. With additional models, we show that a similar pathway naturally
forms GW190814-like events, provided the first phase of mass transfer remains conservative, and the
first-born (lower mass) compact object receives a large natal kick (≳100 km/s) for the subsequent
CE phase to be successful and form a asymmetric mass-ratio GW source. Anchored by the number
of analogous Galactic HMXBs, we estimate rates for such GW events, which broadly agree with their
observed rate. Our work demonstrates a unified formation pathway for highly asymmetric mass-ratio
HMXBs and GW events. Moreover, it highlights the critical role of finding and characterizing local
analogs in different evolutionary phases, and using them as a bridge to understand the origin of GW
sources, especially the outliers like GW190814.

1.INTRODUCTION
Massive stars (>8−10 M ⊙) end their lives in ener-
getic explosions or implosions, often leaving behind a
compact remnant like a black hole (BH) or neutron star
(NS) (e.g, A. Burrows & D. Vartanyan 2021; H. T. Janka
2025; N. Soker 2025; A. Jerkstrand et al. 2026). Most
massive stars live in binaries and higher order systems
(e.g, H. A. Kobulnicky et al. 2014; M. Moe & R. Di Ste-
fano 2017; S. S. R. Offner et al. 2023), a large fraction
of which are in orbits close enough that they will likely
interact at some point over their lifetimes (H. Sana et al.
2012, 2025). Such systems are thought to be the progen-
itors of high-energy phenomena such as X-ray binaries
(XRBs) (e.g, T. M. Tauris & E. P. J. van den Heuvel
2006), stripped envelope supernovae (e.g, N. Smith et al.
Email: neevshah@arizona.edu2011; J. D. Lyman et al. 2016), gravitational wave (GW)
sources (e.g, A. Vigna-G´ omez et al. 2018; T. M. Tauris
et al. 2017; I. Mandel & A. Farmer 2022), gamma-ray
bursts (GRB) (e.g, S. E. Woosley 1993; M. Cantiello
et al. 2007), and various other transients (e.g, R. A.
Chevalier 2012; B. D. Metzger 2022; N. Soker 2022; A.
Grichener & N. Soker 2023).
Although most massive binaries break at the forma-
tion of the first compact object (e.g, M. Renzo et al.
2019), in a minority of cases, a natural outcome is the
presence of compact object(s) in binaries. In the local
Universe, these systems have been observed for decades
as X-ray binaries (see R. A. Remillard & J. E. McClin-
tock 2006 for a review). More recently, astrometry with
Gaia, and other radial velocity surveys have unraveled a
small but growing population of non-interacting binaries
that contain a compact object such as a BH (e.g, K. El-
Badry et al. 2023a,b; S. Chakrabarti et al. 2023; GaiaarXiv:2602.12327v1  [astro-ph.HE]  12 Feb 2026

(e.g, K. El-Badry et al. 2024). Additionally, a handful of
binary neutron star (BNS) systems have been observed
in the Galaxy through pulsar observations (e.g, M. Bur-
gay et al. 2003; R. N. Manchester et al. 2005).
Double compact binaries are strong sources of GWs,
especially close to merger. GWs from merging binary
black holes (BBH) were directly detected for the first
time in 2015 (B. P. Abbott et al. 2016). The sample has
rapidly grown since, with over 200 mergers in the latest
catalog, GWTC-4.0 ( The LIGO Scientific Collaboration
et al. 2025a,b).
In the catalog are a few exceptional events, such
as one of the most3asymmetric mass-ratio4merger,
GW190814, between a compact object of∼2.6 M ⊙,
and a∼23 M ⊙BH (R. Abbott et al. 2020), see Fig.
1. The highly asymmetric mass-ratio of this event, and
the presence of a compact object straddling the “lower
mass-gap” between the heaviest neutron stars and light-
est black holes (e.g, F. ¨Ozel et al. 2010; W. M. Farr et al.
2011, although see A. G. Abac et al. 2024) has been chal-
lenging to interpret for most formation channels. Vari-
3Although GW191219 163120 has a mass-ratio lower than
GW190814, it has a lower SNR and the LVK reports its pa-
rameters as prone to systematic uncertainties due to the lack of
calibrated waveform models in that region of parameter space
(R. Abbott et al. 2023).
4In this work, unless otherwise specified, we define the mass-
ratio asq=m 2/m1, wherem 2≤m 1.ous attempts have been made to explain its formation,
such as through isolated binary evolution (e.g, M. Zevin
et al. 2020; I. Mandel et al. 2021; I. Maga˜ na Hernandez
& K. Breivik 2025), a triple scenario where the 2.6 M ⊙
compact object is the remnant of a previous BNS merger
(W. Lu et al. 2021), and through dynamical interactions
in young star clusters (e.g, M. Arca Sedda 2021).
Due to the unknown BH or NS nature of the lower
mass compact object in GW190814, it is often catego-
rized as an outlier to the underlying population (e.g,
R. Abbott et al. 2021; R. Essick et al. 2022, however,
see also A. Farah et al. 2022). Outlier events challenge
conventional channels for the formation of such systems.
Including or excluding them from analyses can signifi-
cantly bias the inferred population parameters (e.g, S.
Colloms et al. 2025). Therefore, it is important to care-
fully characterize and study outlier events to understand
whether they are true outliers that hint towards an ex-
otic formation scenario, or just rare outcomes of an oth-
erwise standard evolutionary pathway.
GW events are a rare product of massive binary evolu-
tion (see I. Mandel & F. S. Broekgaarden 2022 for a re-
view on rates). This makes it challenging to reconstruct
their past evolutionary history on an individual event-
by-event basis just from the estimated masses and/ or
spins of the compact objects (e.g, K. W. K. Wong et al.
2023). Instead, most studies search for signatures of dif-
ferent formation channels in the overall population prop-
erties, such as the mass, redshift and spin distributions,
3
and possible correlations among them (L. A. C. van Son
et al. 2022, see T. A. Callister 2024 for a review).
However, another way of understanding the forma-
tion of GW sources is by finding and characterizing
their analogs in earlier evolutionary stages. Such sys-
tems are often observed and well studied in the Milky
Way and nearby galaxies. They are important anchors
in the pathway to forming a GW source, and provide
constraints on uncertainties in massive binary evolution,
such as the details of the mass transfer (MT) process
(e.g, K. Sen et al. 2025b), the explodability and na-
tal kick received to compact remnants (e.g, A. Vigna-
G´ omez et al. 2024), and uncertainties in common enve-
lope evolution. Such uncertainties propagate in forming
a GW source, making their astrophysical interpretation
a challenging task.
Utilizing local analogs can be particularly useful for
understanding the formation of outlier events such as
GW190814, which may not fit well with the rest of the
GW population. A key intermediate stage in the path-
way to becoming a gravitational wave source is a po-
tential XRB phase (e.g, K. Sen et al. 2021). Although
few presently observed XRBs in the local Universe will
result in merging compact binaries in the future (e.g,
M. Fishbach & V. Kalogera 2022; M. Gallegos-Garcia
et al. 2022), any compact binary merger originating from
isolated binary evolution will experience a (brief) XRB
phase during its evolution (e.g, N. Langer et al. 2020).
In Fig. 1, we show the mass vs mass-ratio for the known
population of GW events and Galactic HMXBs.
Given the extreme mass-ratio of GW190814, a poten-
tial local analog for it is the runaway HMXB54U 1700-
37/ HD 153919 (M. Falanga et al. 2015). One of the first
X-ray sources discovered in the 1970s (C. Jones et al.
1973), the 3.41 day period binary consists of an O6.5
Iaf+ star HD 153919 (N. R. Walborn 1973). With an
estimated mass of 40−60 M ⊙(e.g, G. Hammerschlag-
Hensberge et al. 2003; M. Falanga et al. 2015), it is one
of the most massive stars in known XRBs (see Fig. 1).
The compact object in this system is equally interest-
ing, with initial estimates putting its mass at≈2.5 M ⊙
(J. S. Clark et al. 2002). However, recent observations
hint that its mass may be lower at≈2 M ⊙(M. Falanga
et al. 2015), but its NS or BH nature remains unclear
(e.g, L. West-Ocampo et al. 2026). Using Hipparcos
data, A. Ankay et al. (2001) identified NGC 6231 as
the potential parent cluster of this system. This was

the optical counterpart at the same location. In this work,
we refer to HMXB 4U 1700-37 as the binary system, unless
otherwise specified.confirmed by V. van der Meij et al. (2021) usingGaia
EDR3, and verified by V. Hambaryan et al. (2022) us-
ing the fullGaiaDR3. They find that the HMXB was
ejected from NGC 6231 about 2 Myr ago, presumably
due to the SN explosion that formed the compact ob-
ject. The young age (<10 Myr) of NGC 6231 (e.g, H.
Sana et al. 2007) implies that the progenitor star of the
compact object had an initial mass>30 M ⊙(A. Ankay
et al. 2001).
The short period of the binary, its highly asymmet-
ric mass-ratio, and young age have been challenging to
interpret. V. van der Meij et al. (2021) proposed the
system to have formed from a massive binary that un-
derwent mass transfer while the more massive (donor)
star was still on the Main Sequence (MS)6, termed as
Case A MT (R. Kippenhahn & A. Weigert 1967). They
also hypothesized that the compact remnant received a
natal kick in a favorable direction that shrinks the orbit.
The presence of a compact object in the lower mass-
gap, and the highly asymmetric mass-ratio of this sys-
tem makes it an interesting case study for understanding
the formation of asymmetric mass-ratio systems such as
GW190814, as they may share a common evolutionary
pathway.
Our goal in this work is two-fold. In Section 2, we
first utilize the rich set of observational constraints for
the HMXB 4U 1700-37/ HD 153919, and using Monte
Carlo simulations reconstruct the properties of the bi-
nary prior to the first (and so far the only) SN in the
system. With these constraints, in Section 3 we com-
pute detailed binary evolution models withMESAto
chart its past evolutionary history and likely progenitor
system. We evaluate the future evolution of the HMXB
in Section 4. In Section 5, we compute additional de-
tailed binary evolution models to explore the formation
of GW190814-like systems. We demonstrate the condi-
tions in which such a system can form, and its similar-
ities and differences with the HMXB described earlier.
We also provide estimates for the rates of such events in
Section 6. In Sections 7 and 8, we discuss certain impli-
cations and caveats for our models, and summarise our
results.
2.RECONSTRUCTION OF THE HMXB 4U 1700-37
BEFORE SUPERNOVA
In this section, we use Monte Carlo simulations to
infer the pre-SN properties of the runaway HMXB 4U
1700-37/ HD 153919. We utilize several observational

R. E. Taam (2008) to explain the formation of an isolated neu-
tron star in the young Westerlund 1 cluster.

constraints such as the mass of the companion star and
the compact object, the current orbital period, and its
systemic velocity with respect to its parent cluster NGC
6231.
The occurence of a SN in a binary can have a sig-
nificant effect on its orbital properties (e.g, J. Boersma
1961; W. N. Brandt & P. Podsiadlowski 1994; T. Wagg
et al. 2025a). There can be diverse outcomes depend-
ing on the amount of mass lost in the explosion. The
momentum carried by the SN ejecta can change the bi-
nary orbit (referred to as the “Blauuw kick”, A. Blaauw
1961). Due to asymmetries in the explosion and/or neu-
trino emission, the compact remnants can also receive a
natal kick (J. I. Katz (1975), see S. Popov et al. (2025)
for a review). The strength and directions of natal kicks,
and its dependence on the nature of the compact rem-
nant (NS or BH) are not well known (e.g, A. Vigna-
G´ omez et al. 2024; P. Nagarajan & K. El-Badry 2025;
P. Disberg & I. Mandel 2025; R. Valli et al. 2025). The
combination of mass loss and natal kicks can lead to
several observational consequences such as binary dis-
ruption (e.g, E. De Donder et al. 1997; M. Renzo et al.
2019), and if it remains bound, a change in the orbital
period, eccentricity and even a systemic velocity to the
binary as a whole.
2.1.Methods
With the help of observational constraints on the pa-
rameters of a post-SN binary, we can infer its pre-SN pa-
rameters. We follow the setup in K. El-Badry (2024a),
which in turn uses W. N. Brandt & P. Podsiadlowski
(1994) for calculating the outcomes of a SN in a binary.
These calculations implicitly assume that the mass lost
in a SN explosion is instantaneously removed from the
system, given the very high ejecta speeds in a SN in
comparison to the orbital velocity.
We start by creating an initial population of pre-SN
binaries, where we sample over the pre-SN masses and
orbital periods. We assume that the pre-SN binary or-
bit is circular. This is justified as we model short period
binaries that undergo mass transfer, where tides are ex-
pected to have circularized the orbit (however, see J. J.
Eldridge (2009); K. A. Rocha et al. (2025); A. Parkosidis
et al. (2025) for studies on eccentric MT). The post-SN
binary properties depend on the pre-SN binary param-
eters and the details of the SN explosion. The relevant
parameters are the amount of mass lost in the SN, and
the speed and direction of the compact object natal kick.
We neglect any change in the mass of the companion star
during the SN (T. M. Tauris & R. J. Takens 1998; R.
Hirai et al. 2018; M. Ogata et al. 2021). This specifies allthe relevant parameters needed to generate the post-SN
population from the pre-SN binary population.
The mass of the progenitor star that forms the com-
pact object is denoted bym 1,pre−SN , while its compan-
ion has a massm 2. We denote the pre-SN orbital pe-
riod asP pre−SN . We generate a population of 107bi-
naries withm 2sampled uniformly between 40−50 M ⊙,
which roughly spans the estimated mass of the visible
companion today (V. van der Meij et al. 2021). We fix
the post-SN mass of the compact object (m 1,post−SN )
to be 2 M ⊙, and sample the mass lost in the SN explo-
sion (∆m) uniformly between 0−20 M ⊙. Therefore, the
pre-SN mass of the progenitor of the compact object as
m1,pre−SN = 2 M ⊙+ ∆m. We assume that the mass of
the compact object immediately post-SN is similar to its
measured mass today, as compact objects in HMXBs are
not expected to gain substantial mass due to the short
timescale of the HMXB phase (e.g, T.-W. Wong et al.
2012; T. M. Tauris & E. P. J. van den Heuvel 2023).
We sample the pre-SN period of the binary uniformly
between 0−30 days. Although we allow for extremely
short periods pre-SN, they are not realistic as the stars
will not fit inside a very small orbit. We sample the natal
kicks to the compact object isotropically in direction,
with magnitudes (v kick) from a lognormal distribution
withµ= 5.60 andσ= 0.68 (P. Disberg & I. Mandel
2025).
Having defined the pre-SN binary population
(m1,pre−SN , m2, P) and the relevant parameters for the
SN explosion (∆m , v kick) , we can now compute the
properties of the post-SN binary (or disrupted) pop-
ulation. From the post-SN population, we select for
systems that satisfy the observational constraints for
the HMXB 4U 1700-37, (i.e,) they are bound (e <1)
and have gained a systemic velocity (v sys) between
50−80 km/s (V. van der Meij et al. 2021). We assume
that most of its systemic velocity with respect to its
birth cluster can be attributed to its post-SN systemic
velocity, neglecting its evolution over time (during the
runaway phase) and the impact of the velocity disper-
sion of the cluster (M. C. Ram´ ırez-Tannus et al. 2021).
However, the details of this depend on accurately mod-
eling the effects of the cluster or galactic potential (T.
Wagg et al. 2025b).
The presen day orbital period of the XRB is∼
3.41 days (N. Islam & B. Paul 2016), but it is possible
that the period immediately post-SN period was differ-
ent. It could have evolved to its current state due to
wind mass loss from the companion star (that widens
the orbit) and tidal effects (which may either shrink or
widen the orbit, e.g, N. Britavskiy et al. 2024). To ac-
count for this, we relax our post-SN period constraints
5
and select for systems that have a post-SN orbital period
between 2−5 days. We choose a lower limit of 2 days,
as shorter periods imply that the companion star would
have filled its Roche Lobe after the SN, which is not
plausible given its current evolutionary state.
We do not impose any constraints on eccentricty, other
than that it is bound post-SN, as the current eccentricity
(if any) of the binary may not be representative of what
it was immediately post-SN due to tidal circularization.
2.2.Results
In Fig. 2, we show a corner plot of the pre-SN mass of
the compact object progenitor, the natal kick imparted
to its remnant, and the pre-SN orbital period of the sys-
tems that satisfy the imposed observational constraints.
The shape of the probability distribution depends on
the assumed pre-SN population. In this scenario, we
uniformly explore the entire parameter space of interest
that is physically relevant to this system given its obser-
vational constraints (listed in the legend in Fig. 2).

pre-SN mass, pre-SN period and natal kick strength of the
binary population that satisfy the observational constraints
of the HMXB. Diagonal panels show their 1D marginal dis-
tributions (with median and 1σuncertainties reported on the
top), while other panels show correlations between different
parameters, with darker colors representing regions of higher
density. The goal of our binary evolution models is to match
these pre-SN constraints.We find that the pre-SN mass of the progenitor of the
compact object must have been between 4−13 M ⊙to
explain its current orbital period and systemic velocity.
Due to the short post-SN orbital period seen today, we
also find that the pre-SN orbital period is constrained
to be less than 13 days. Although we do not impose
any constraints on the pre-SN orbital period, it is un-
likely to have been very small (≲1−2 days) as the
two stars would not have fit inside a very small pre-
SN orbit. We also find that large pre-SN periods (>5
days) require large natal kicks (>100 km/s), as it is
not possible to shrink a binary’s post-SN period just
through mass loss during the SN. This is important be-
cause the first phase of MT in binaries, if stable, leads
to mass-ratio reversal and orbital widening in most sce-
narios (M. Renzo et al. 2019). We also know that this
system originated in a young cluster with a high turn-
off mass≥30 M ⊙. Since our Monte Carlo simulations
suggest that the progenitor of the compact object had a
pre-SN mass≤13 M ⊙, it must have lost a large amount
of mass. This strongly suggests that this system likely
went through a phase of MT in the past (from the pro-
genitor of the compact object onto the current visible
star), which would have widened its orbit. Therefore,
the pre-SN period was likely large enough that a natal
kick is necessarily needed to shrink the orbit post-SN to
its current state (V. van der Meij et al. 2021). Thus,
although our Monte Carlo simulations allow for pre-SN
periods smaller than≈5 days, we do not expect such
solutions to be physically plausible.
3.EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY OF THE HMXB 4U
1700-37/ HD 153919
We utilize the pre-SN constraints that we obtained
from our Monte Carlo simulations to reconstruct the
past evolutionary history of the HMXB 4U-1700-37/ HD
153919 with detailed binary evolution models, and de-
scribe our setup below.
3.1.Methods
We simulate the evolution of massive binaries using
the stellar evolution codeMESA(B. Paxton et al.
2011, 2013, 2015, 2018, 2019; A. S. Jermyn et al. 2023,
r24.08.01). Our inlists and output data are publicly
available7at doi:10.5281/zenodo.18615967 and we sum-
marize relevant parameters and assumptions below. We
also perform resolution tests, and describe them in Ap-
pendix B.
7We also include scripts to reproduce all the figures in this work
at doi:10.5281/zenodo.18615967

We use the Ledoux criterion (P. Ledoux 1947) to find
convective zones, and assume a mixing length parameter
αMLT= 2.0. We include semiconvection (α sc= 1) (N.
Langer et al. 1983), and thermohaline mixing (α th= 1)
(R. Kippenhahn et al. 1980). To account for convec-
tive boundary overshooting above the core, we use the
exponential model from F. Herwig (2000) with free pa-
rameters (f, f 0) = (4.25×10−2,10−3) (A. Claret & G.
Torres 2018), which broadly reproduces the width of
the Main Sequence (MS) for a single 16 M ⊙star (I.
Brott et al. 2011). We do not account for convective
boundary over/undershooting for off-center convective
layers. To aid in regions at the Eddington limit where
convection is inefficient, we utilize the local implicit en-
hancement of the convective flux in superadiabatic re-
gions (use superad reductionfrom A. S. Jermyn et al.
2023).
To limit the computational difficulties in modeling
massive interacting binaries, we include rotation only in
the accretor, while we fix the donor to be non-rotating8.
The accreted material carries angular momentum which
can spin-up the star, which is observed in accretor stars,
for example, a fraction of runaways (A. Blaauw 1993)
such asζOphiuchi (T. Zehe et al. 2018; M. Renzo & Y.
G¨ otberg 2021), in Be stars (T. Rivinius & R. Klement
2026) and blue lurkers or stragglers (E. Leiner et al.
2019). We treat rotation in the “shellular” approxima-
tion (J. P. Zahn 1992; S. Ekstr¨ om et al. 2012), where the
angular velocitiesωare constant on isobaric surfaces, ef-
fectively assuming strong angular momentum transport
in the horizontal direction due to turbulence. We start
our accretor models with a Ω/Ω crit= 0 at Zero-Age
Main Sequence (ZAMS), but this can change due to the
gain/ loss of angular momentum through tides, winds or
mass transfer. We also include the rotational enhance-
ment of the wind mass loss (N. Langer 1998) to prevent
the accretor from reaching critical rotation and regu-
late the mass-transfer efficiency (see below and also T.
Lechien et al. 2025; K. Sen et al. 2025b; Z. Xing et al.
2026). We include several rotational mixing processes in
a diffusion approximation, such as Eddington-Sweet cir-
culation (P. A. Sweet 1950), secular and dynamic shear
instabilities, and the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke (GSF)
instability (see A. Heger et al. 2000 for a review of these
processes). We assume a Spruit-Taylor dynamo (H. C.
Spruit 2002) for treating the transport of angular mo-
8However, see D. D. Hendriks & R. G. Izzard (2023) for impacts
of the donor’s rotation on mass transfer dynamics, although
such effects are not explicitly included in 1D stellar evolution
codes such asMESA.mentum, and choose the same parameters as in A. Heger
et al. (2000).
Stellar winds are a critical ingredient of massive star
evolution, as they can modify their internal structure
(e.g, M. Renzo et al. 2017; A. Romagnolo et al. 2026)
and also affect the orbital evolution in binaries. For stars
with a surface effective temperatureT eff>11000 K, we
utilize the mass loss prescriptions from R. Bj¨ orklund
et al. (2023), unless the surface hydrogen mass fraction
falls below 0.4, in which case we use the optically thick
Wolf-Rayet (WR) wind mass loss rates from T. Nugis &
H. J. G. L. M. Lamers (2000). For cooler stars with a
Teff<10000 K, we use the mass-loss rates from L. Decin
et al. (2024) but do not allow it to exceed 10−6M⊙/yr.
We interpolate linearly between the hot and cool winds
for the temperature ranges 10000−11000 K.
We treat mass transfer in a binary using the scheme
described in U. Kolb & H. Ritter (1990). We assume
that mass transfer is fully conservative until the accre-
tor reaches a maximum Ω/Ω crit= 0.9, after which the
mass-transfer efficiency depends on the rotationally en-
hanced wind mass loss. We assume that the specific
angular momentum and entropy of the transferred mass
is equal to the corresponding values at the surface of
the accretor, and the chemical composition is set by the
stratification of the donor. The transferred mass that is
not accreted leaves the binary system carrying with it
the specific angular momentum of the orbital motion of
the accretor (G. E. Soberman et al. 1997; E. P. J. van
den Heuvel et al. 2017). We also include tidal effects
(J. P. Zahn 1977; P. Hut 1981; J. R. Hurley et al. 2002),
which can have a significant impact on the spins and
orbital evolution of close binaries.
3.2.Results
Based on the results of our Monte Carlo simulations
in Section 2.2, we compute binary evolution models at
solar metallicity (Z ⊙= 0.0146, M. Asplund et al. 2009)
that can reproduce i) the pre-SN mass of the progeni-
tor of the compact object ii) the estimated mass of the
companion star in the HMXB today and iii) the pre-SN
orbital period of the binary. To illustrate the evolution
and structure of our binary models, we focus our pre-
sentation on a fiducial model that can explain the past
evolutionary history of the HMXB 4U 1700-37. This cor-
responds to a binary of initial masses 40 M ⊙and 28 M ⊙
in a tight 3 day orbit. In Appendix C, we show a small
grid with variations in the initial parameters.
In Fig. 3, we show the evolution of the donor (top) and
accretom (middle) on separate HR diagrams. We also
show the evolution of their masses in the bottom panel.
Due to the short initial period, the donor overflows its

(MS) itself. This leads to a phase of mass transfer from
the donor to the accretor, referred to as Case A (R. Kip-
penhahn & A. Weigert 1967). This consists of an initial
thermal timescale mass transfer (∼0.2 Myr), known as
fast Case A (highlighted in blue in Fig. 3). As the donor
regains thermal equilibrium, it slowly grows in size on a
nuclear timescale, which leads to a steady period of mass
transfer referred to as slow Case A (highlighted in red in
Fig. 3). This phase ends around∼5 Myr, which roughly
corresponds to when the donor has finished its supply of
hydrogen in its core. It starts contracting on a thermal
timescale, ending RLOF. At this stage, the donor has
lost around∼18 M ⊙and has a mass of∼22 M ⊙. Due
to the stripping of its envelope during MT, the surface
has an elevated helium mass fraction (Y surf= 0.67) and
is hot with aT eff∼42500 K. The mass of the helium
core at this point is almost 17.2 M ⊙.
On the other hand, the accretor (still on the MS) has
grown from an initial 28 M ⊙to≈40.9 M ⊙. This corre-
sponds to an average mass transfer efficiency⟨β RLOF⟩=
|∆M acc|/|∆M don| ≈0.75. This is due to the short or-
bital period of the binary, as tidal interactions allow
mass transfer to remain fairly conservative. Due to the
increase in mass, the accretor now has a luminosity of
log10(L/L⊙)≈5.6 and a surface temperature of 39400 K
(the end of the highlighted red phase in the bottom panel
of Fig. 3).
The orbital period of the binary only widened from
an initial period of 3 days to∼3.7 days post-MT. The
donor star, which still has a thin hydrogen envelope
of∼4.7 M ⊙, rapidly expands on a thermal timescale
during hydrogen shell burning (e.g, Y. G¨ otberg et al.
2017; E. Laplace et al. 2020), and again overflows its
Roche Lobe. As this occurs after the initial Case A mass
transfer, this phase is referred to as Case AB (with the
B referencing mass transfer occuring after the MS but
before helium depletion R. Kippenhahn & A. Weigert
1967). This phase is highlighted in green in Fig. 3. The
donor loses an additional∼3.5 M ⊙, bringing its total
mass down to 18.4 M ⊙. Tides prevent the accretor from
reaching critical rotation, and it is again able to accrete
most of the transferred mass, growing to∼44 M ⊙. This
phase ends just after≈10000 yr, which roughly corre-
sponds to the thermal timescale of the donor. It is now
even more stripped of hydrogen (surface mass fraction
∼0.18), and starts contracting towards higher surface
temperatures.
Around the same time, it ignites helium in its center,
and the core-helium burning phase lasts≈0.44 Myr.
During this phase, it has a hot helium rich surface, and
8
would resemble a Wolf-Rayet9star (e.g, T. Shenar et al.
2020) with a strong optically thick wind. These mass
loss rates are of the order of 10−6−10−5M⊙/yr, and
the donor star loses an additional∼6 M ⊙during the
WR phase until helium depletion. At this point, it is
just a few thousand years away from core-collapse (e.g,
T. A. Weaver et al. 1978), and we terminate its evo-
lution inMESA. It has a mass of∼12.5 M ⊙, with a
Carbon-Oxygen (CO) core mass of∼10.6 M ⊙and a
central12C/16O∼0.38. There is no hydrogen left on
the surface, which mostly consists of helium, carbon and
some oxygen. Meanwhile, the initially less massive star
(representing the current visible star in the XRB) has a
mass of 43.4 M ⊙. The orbital period of the binary has in-
creased to∼6 days, primarily due to the orbital widen-
ing caused by wind mass loss from the donor during its
core-helium burning phase (T. Nugis & H. J. G. L. M.
Lamers 2000).
The pre-SN mass of the progenitor of the compact
object, and the pre-SN orbital period align with our
expectations of its pre-SN properties from the Monte
Carlo simulations in Section 2.2. The mass of the accre-
tor in our models, which corresponds to the visible star
in the HMXB is also consistent with its mass estimated
through observations.
At the end of the donor star’s life, it may successfully
explode in a stripped envelope SNe and leave behind
a 2 M ⊙compact object (see Section 7.4 for a discussion
on explodability). Once the accretor grows large enough
that it is close to filling its Roche Lobe, the system would
resemble the HMXB 4U 1700-37 that we observe today.
Due to previous mass accetion, we find that the surface
of the companion star would appear to be enriched in
helium and CNO-processed nitrogen, with surface mass
fractions of≈0.42 and≈4×10−3,respectively. In
Section 7, we discuss certain limitations of our fiducial
model, and provide further justification for why this sys-
tem likely formed through Case A MT.
4.CAN THE HMXB 4U 1700-37 FORM A GW
SOURCE IN THE FUTURE?
Once the companion star HD 153919 in the HMXB
fills its Roche Lobe10, it will start transferring mass
onto the compact object. However, given the highly
asymmetric mass-ratio of the system (q≈1/20), this is
likely to become unstable (see also Section 7.6, M. Quast
9Note that while Wolf-Rayet is a spectroscopic class, we do not
compute synthetic spectra. In our stellar evolution models, we
switch to Wolf-Rayet wind mass loss rates based on the surface
temperature and helium abundance, as defined in Section 3.1.
10The X-rays observed today are likely from wind accretion, as
expected in most HMXBs.et al. 2019; A. Olejak et al. 2025). We find that the
mass transfer rate exceeds 0.1 M ⊙/yr, which generally
signifies the onset of dynamical instability (J. Klencki &
B. D. Metzger 2025). We assume such systems to un-
dergo a Common Envelope (CE) phase (T. Fragos et al.
2023).
We do not attempt to model the CE phase directly
withMESA, and instead utilize theαλformalism (R. F.
Webbink 1984; M. de Kool 1990) to study its outcome.
This depends on the binding energy of the envelope of
the star filling its Roche Lobe, as well as energy sources
such as the orbital energy that can be used to unbind
the envelope. The effective energy of the envelope,E env,
depends on the density structure and internal energy of
the star, and is given by–
Eenv(m) =ZM

−Gm′
r(m′)+αthu(m′)

Here,mrefers to the mass coordinate corresponding
to the core-envelope boundary, andMis the total mass
of the star. The first term in the integral refers to the
gravitational potential energy of the mass shell at coor-
dinatem′. In the second term,urefers to the available
internal energy in that shell, andα this the fraction of
internal energy that can be used to unbind the envelope.
If such sources are available to eject the envelope, it re-
duces the gravitational binding energy and we refer to
their sum as the effective energy of the envelope.
The core-envelope boundary is not well defined, and
is sensitive to overshooting and other mixing processes
in single stars (e.g, N. Ivanova et al. 2020). In bina-
ries, rejuvenation plays an important role in determining
the boundary location (M. Renzo et al. 2023; C. Lan-
dri et al. 2025). To account for these uncertainties, we
use three different definitions for determining its loca-
tion, following T. Fragos et al. (2023). We define the
core-envelope boundary as the outermost mass coordi-
nate (m=M core) where the hydrogen mass fractionX
is less than 0.01,0.1,0.3, respectively. The effective en-
velope energy is often re-parameterized usingλ(M. de
Kool 1990), defined as–
Eenv=−GM∗Menv
λR∗(2)
whereM ∗is the mass of the star,M env≡M∗−M coreis
the mass of its envelope, andE env≡E env(m=M core).
We can then quantify the outcome of a CE phase using
energy conservation, given by
αCE∆Eorb=E bind (3)

whereα CErefers to the fraction of orbital energy that

mass of the compact object,a ianda frefer to the orbital
separations before and after the CE phase, respectively,
andE bind=|E env|refers to the effective binding energy
of the envelope.
We consider a CE phase to be successful if the post-
CE orbital separationa fis large enough such that
the remnant core of the star that loses its envelope
Rcore≡R(m=M core) fits inside its Roche-Lobe. This
can be rephrased as the minimumα CEneeded for the
remnant core to just fill its Roche-Lobe post-CE. In our
fiducial model, if the requiredα CEis less than 1, we
define the CE phase to be successful, while for values
greater than 1, we assume that there is a premature
merger between the compact object and the compan-
ion’s core before the envelope can be ejected. However,
αCE>1 does not necessarily imply a failed CE phase,
as there may be additional energy sources such as en-
ergy released by accretion onto the compact object (see
N. Ivanova et al. 2020 for a review) that may help eject
the envelope. We neglect any potential response of the
remnant core to the CE phase, that isR coredoes not
change, and energy losses via radiation.
We save the internal structure of the companion star
in our fiducial model for the HMXB 4U 1700-37/ HD
153919 at the onset of RLOF, and compute the bind-
ing energy of its envelope. The star is still on the MS
and has a central hydrogen mass fraction of≈0.22.
Therefore, using theX= 0.3 definition, we get the
core-envelope boundary to be located at≈28.6 M ⊙,
which roughly lies at the boundary of the present day
convective MS core of the star. Using this boundary
location, and the most optimistic assumption that all
of the internal energy in the envelope is available, we
get the effective binding energy of the envelope to be
≈2.35×1050erg. This corresponds to aλ≈0.5. Using
the energy balance Eqn. 3, we find that the minimum
αCEthat would be required for a successful CE phase
is≈18. Such anα CEis quite large, and implies that
the CE phase is likely going to fail to eject the envelope,
and lead to a premature merger between the core of the
star and the compact object, in agreement with previous
work (e.g, P. Podsiadlowski 1994; E. P. J. van den Heuvel
et al. 2017; T. M. Tauris et al. 2017; R. Hainich et al.
2020). Although such systems are not GW sources for
ground-based detectors, they could appear as energetic
transients (see A. Grichener (2025) for a review on otherpossible multi-messenger signatures) such as LFBOTs
(J. Klencki & B. D. Metzger 2025) or form a Thorne-
˙Zytkow Object (e.g, K. S. Thorne & A. N. Zytkow 1975;
K. Nathaniel et al. 2025; A. O’Grady et al. 2026).
5.FORMATION OF GW190814
In the previous section, we constructed detailed bi-
nary evolution models at solar metallicity to demon-
strate the past evolutionary history of the most asym-
metric HMXB in the Galaxy. However, we found that it
is unlikely to lead to the formation of a highly asymmet-
ric GW source, as the system will prematurely merge in
a future CE phase due to the star’s high envelope bind-
ing energy. In this section, we compute another set of
detailed binary evolution models, and demonstrate sce-
narios in which a CE phase is successful, and leads to
the formation of a highly asymmetric GW source such
as GW190814.
The progenitor binaries of the GW events detected by
the LVK formed when the universe was much younger,
and therefore likely metal poor. L. A. C. van Son et al.
(2025) find that BNS formation is not metallicity de-
pendent, while BBH formation is more efficient at lower
metallicity. For these reasons, to describe the forma-
tion of a GW190814-like binary that consists of a mas-
sive BH, we computeMESAmodels at a metallicty of
Z=Z ⊙/10 = 0.00146.
A key difference in stellar evolution at lower metal-
licity is that the mass lost through line-driven winds
becomes signifcantly weaker (e.g., J. S. Vink et al. 2001;
M. R. Mokiem et al. 2007). In the Section 3.2, we found
that the progenitor of the compact object lost a signif-
icant amount of mass during its evolution, particularly
during its core-helium burning phase. This was crucial
in lowering its pre-SN mass down to what we inferred
from our Monte Carlo simulations, and potentially aid
in its explodability.
Since we now compute binary evolution models at a
lower metallicity, we also lower the initial masses of our
stars. However, we emphasize that the broad evolution-
ary pathway remains the same. Based on an initial ex-
ploratory work, our fiducial GW190814-like model con-
sists of a binary with initial parameters 27 M ⊙+ 25 M ⊙
in a 3.5 day orbit. Donors that are substantially more
massive than 27 M ⊙will result in pre-SN masses that
are potentially too large to successfully explode. On the
other hand, accretors that are much less massive than
25 M⊙will leave behind smaller BHs, which will not ap-
pear as GW sources that arehighly asymmetricin their
mass-ratio.
10
5.1.Evolution before first-SN
In Fig. 4, we show the evolutionary track of the ac-
cretor in the binary on the HR diagram (top panel), as
well as the evolution of their masses over time (bottom
panel).
As stars at lower metallicity are more compact, mass
transfer begins later in the evolution. After 5.9 Myr, the
donor star overflows its Roche-Lobe during the MS, initi-
ating Case A mass transfer. This phase lasts for around
0.75 Myr. Once the donor reaches TAMS, it starts con-
tracting, and detaches itself from its Roche-Lobe. At
this stage, the donor star has a mass of 16.9 M ⊙, while
the accretor has grown to about 34.9 M ⊙. Due to the
short orbital period, strong tidal forces prevent the ac-
cretor from reaching critical rotation, and mass transfer
remains nearly fully conservative. The donor soon re-
expands once it starts hydrogen shell burning, initiating
the second phase of Case AB mass transfer, similar to
our fiducial model in Section 3.2. At the end of this
phase, the binary consists of a 14.4 M ⊙donor, and a
37.4 M ⊙accretor in a tight 6.4 day orbit. Around the
same time, the donor contracts (ending MT) and ig-
nites helium in its core, which lasts for∼0.5 Myr. At
core-helium depletion, the donor is left with a mass of
12.7 M ⊙, with a carbon-oxygen core mass of 10.7 M ⊙
(and a central12C/16O∼0.39). On the other hand, the
accretor, now the more massive star in this system has
a mass of 37.3 M ⊙.
Since we terminate our donor models at core helium
depletion, we neglect the impact of binary and tidal in-
teractions after this point. We assume that at least in
some cases, the donor star successfully explodes at the
end of its life, and leaves behind a NS, or a low mass BH
due to fallback or accretion during the SN. This may re-
semble the lower mass compact object in GW190814.
We discuss the effects of explodability in more detail in
Sec. 7.4. The compact object may also receive a natal
kick at birth, in analogy with the case of the HMXB
4U 1700-37. Depending on its strength and direction, a
variety of post-SN outcomes are possible. This is unlike
the Galactic HMXB 4U 1700-37, which was bounded by
observational constraints on the post-SN orbit.
5.2.Evolution after first-SN
For systems that remain bound post-SN, the binary
consists of a compact object and a companion star,
which was originally the accretor. Depending on the
size of the orbit post-SN and the radial evolution of the
companion star, it may (or may not) fill its Roche-Lobe
during its evolution.
If it does fill its Roche-Lobe, a phase of reverse-RLOF
onto the compact object will ensue. The outcome of

event.
this phase sensitively depends on the evolutionary state
of the companion star and the stability of mass transfer
at the onset of RLOF. The highly asymmetric mass-
ratio of the system (q= 2.6/37.3≈1/14) is similar to
the mass-ratio of the Galactic HMXB that we described
in Section 2.2. We again assume that mass transfer be-
comes unstable and leads to a CE phase.
5.2.1.Fate of CE phase
We use theαλformalism, as described in Section 4 to
determine the outcome of the CE phase. However, as the
post-SN orbital separation can take a range of values,
the density structure of the star, and correspondingly
11
the binding energy of its envelope at the onset of CE
could vary significantly.
To account for the different possible outcomes post-
SN, we “detach” the companion star from the compact
object, and follow its evolution as a single star inMESA
(following M. Renzo & Y. G¨ otberg 2021; M. Renzo et al.
2023). This allows us to model the evolution of its den-
sity structure and envelope binding energy along with its
radial evolution, thereby accounting for different possi-
ble post-SN orbital separations11.
In the top panel of Fig. 5, we show the effective bind-
ing energy of the envelope of the companion star as a
function of its total stellar radius, which we use as a
proxy for its temporal evolution. For most of its evo-
lution, as the star grows in radius, there is a moderate
decrease in its binding energy. Notably, our models ig-
nite helium in their core while crossing the Hertzprung-
Gap, and spend most of the core-helium burning phase
in a blue loop (see Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, M. Renzo et al.
2023). However, during the end of its core-helium burn-
ing phase, when it has grown to a size of almost 1250 R ⊙,
it developes a loosely bound convective envelope and
starts ascending the Red Super Giant (RSG) branch
(highlighted in purple in Fig. 4). This dramatically
decreases the effective binding energy of its envelope,
making it easier to eject during a potential CE phase
(e.g, J. Klencki et al. 2021).
Using the effective binding energy of the star’s enve-
lope, and the method described in Section 4, we calcu-
late the minimumα CEthat would be required to eject
it as a function of its stellar radius. This is shown in the
bottom panel of Fig. 5, where the line colors and shaded
bands follow the same convention as the top panel. For
most of its evolution, whenR ∗<1250 R ⊙, the minimum
αCErequired to successfully eject the envelope is much
greater than one. These correspond to the cases similar
to the HMXB 4U 1700-37, where we assume that the
CE phase would fail, and there would be a premature
merger between the compact object and the core of the
star.
However, forR ∗>1250 R ⊙, we find that the min-
imumα CErequired to eject falls below one. In such
scenarios, we assume that the CE phase is successful in
ejecting the envelope, and would leave behind a tight,
and potentially circularized binary consisting of the rem-
nant core of the star that lost its envelope, and the com-
pact object.
11We neglect the impact of tides and potential irradiation from
an accreting compact object in orbit around the star.

that survive the CE phase, their remnant cores just have
≈0.03 Myr left to the end of core-helium burning phase.
They have a helium core mass of≈20 M ⊙, and radius
≈0.8 R ⊙, which would appear as a WR star. For an
αCE= 1, the post-CE orbital separation is≈2−5 R ⊙,
depending on whether we exclude or include internal en-
ergy. In either case, the remnant core comfortably fits
inside the new Roche-Lobe. Due to the short time left,
we assume that the mass of the core will not change
significantly. It may appear as an X-ray source, sim-
ilar to Cygnus X-3, which consists of a massive WR
12
star in a tight orbit with a compact companion (e.g,
K. Belczynski et al. 2013; A. Veledina et al. 2024). At
core-collapse, such a heavy core in our fiducial model is
potentially too large to explode. It will likely implode
on itself with little to no mass loss, leaving behind a
≈20 M ⊙BH. Assuming that such massive BH’s receive
negligible natal kicks, these systems would now consists
of a NS or a low-mass BH with a massive≈20 M ⊙
BH companion in a tight circular orbit of a few solar
radii. At this time, the compact binary emits GWs at
a frequency of≈0.1 mHz, which lies in the LISA fre-
quency range (P. Amaro-Seoane et al. 2023), and may
be a detectable source. The subsequent evolution of this
system will be dominated by a GW-driven inspiral. For
post-CE orbital separations of 2−5 R ⊙, we find that
it takes at most≈80 Myr for the inspiral to end in a
finale as a compact binary coalescence that may be ob-
served by the LVK detectors (P. C. Peters & J. Mathews
1963). These signals would consist of a low mass com-
pact object that may be a NS or BH, with a massive
BH companion, that would appear similar to the highly
asymmetric mass-ratio event GW190814. Since these
are post-CE systems and the formation of the massive
BH likely did not induce any significant eccentricity in
the binary, we do not expect any measureable eccentric-
ity at merger. Additionally, we also do not expect the
second born massive BH to have any significant spin,
which is also consistent with the estimated spin of the
primary BH in GW190814. We discuss this in more de-
tail in Section 7.5.
6.RATES OF GW190814-LIKE EVENTS
In Section 3.2, we demonstrated that the highly asym-
metric mass-ratio Galactic HMXB 4U 1700-37 can form
through isolated binary evolution, starting from a rel-
atively equal mass-ratio binary that undergoes conser-
vative mass transfer. In Section 5, we showed that a
similar formation pathway works at lower metallicity as
well, and leads to the formation of a highly asymmet-
ric mass-ratio GW190814 like source if the CE phase is
successful. Assuming an evolutionary link between the
two systems, we can utilize the number of highly asym-
metric mass-ratio Galactic HMXBs observed to estimate
the rate of highly asymmetric mass-ratio GW events like
GW190814. There exist two such HMXBs in the Galaxy.
One of them is the Galactic HMXB 4U 1700-37 that we
modeled in Section 3.2. The other is the X-ray pul-
sar GX 301-2, which has a≈36−50 M ⊙B supergiant
companion, Wray 977 (L. Kaper et al. 1995). Assum-
ing that the number of Milky Way equivalent galaxies
(MWEG) in the local Universe is∼1.16×107Gpc−3
(R. K. Kopparapu et al. 2008; J. Abadie et al. 2010),and that the average lifetime of observing a binary in
the HMXB phase is≈0.1 Myr (T. M. Tauris & E. P. J.
van den Heuvel 2023), the local rate of observing highly
asymmetric mass-ratio HMXBs is given by–
RHMXB ∼2
MWEG×1.16×107MWEG
Gpc−3×1
0.1 Myr
(5)
= 232 Gpc−3yr−1(6)
However, as we demonstrated in Sections 3.2 and 5,
not all highly asymmetric mass-ratio HMXBs will form
GW190814-like events. We found that a successful CE
phase occurs if the companion star fills its Roche-Lobe
when it is a RSG with a loosely bound convective enve-
lope. In our fiducial model, this requires the size of the
Roche Lobe after the first-SN to be≈1250−1500 R ⊙. In
Fig. 6, we show the distribution of possible Roche-Lobe
sizes after the first-SN (calculated using fits from P. P.
Eggleton 1983). Based on our fiducial model, we assume
that a 12.7 M ⊙star explodes to leave behind a 2.6 M ⊙
compact object, and it has a companion of≈37 M ⊙
in a≈7 day orbit. The only free parameters that de-
termine the size of the post-SN RL are the magnitude
and direction of the natal kick. Similar to Section 2.1,
we assume isotropic natal kicks (v kick) to arise from a
lognormal distribution (P. Disberg & I. Mandel 2025).
We find that≈42% of systems are disrupted due to
the SN. For the systems that remain bound, the yel-
low shaded band corresponds to post-SN Roche Lobes
that are smaller than 1250 R ⊙, which would only ap-
pear as a highly asymmetric mass-ratio HMXB, but not
form a GW source due to a failed CE phase. The pur-
ple shaded band corresponds to post-SN Roche Lobes
that are≈1250−1500 R ⊙, which will have a success-
ful CE phase and form a highly asymmetric mass-ratio
GW source. The blue shaded band corresponds to or-
bits that are so large that the star never fills its Roche
Lobe. For the assumed kick distribution, we find that
only≈0.24% of systems that appear as a HMXB can
form a GW source through a successful CE phase. No-
tably, the first-born compact objects in those systems
all receive natal kicks greater than 100 km/s (bottom
panel of Fig. 6), similar to what we needed to explain
the HMXB 4U 1700-37 in Section 2.2. Thus we can es-
timate the local rate of highly asymmetric mass-ratio
GW190814-like events to be
RGW∼0.0024× R HMXB ∼0.56 Gpc−3yr−1(7)
This estimate is within an order of magnitude of the
1−23 Gpc−3yr−1rate of GW190814-like events esti-
13
mated by the LVK collaboration (R. Abbott et al. 2020),
which is based on a single event (GW190814). However,
we caution that our rate estimate depends on key un-
certain factors such as the lifetime of the HMXB phase,
and the radial extent of the star for a successful CE
phase. A detailed rate calculation also requires the
use of population-synthesis techniques to account for
the star formation history, metallicity dependence, and
other uncertainties in linking Galactic HMXBs to GW
events (e.g., M. Zevin et al. 2020; M. Oh et al. 2023; I.
Maga˜ na Hernandez & K. Breivik 2025). The observed
rate of highly asymmetric mass-ratio GW events may
also include contributions from other formation scenar-
ios, both within the context of isolated binary evolution,
as well as other pathways such as dynamical interactions
or triple evolution.
7.DISCUSSION
In this section we discuss additional observational con-
straints for the HMXB 4U 1700-37/ HD 153919, and
certain assumptions and caveats for our corresponding
models. We discuss the explodability of the first-born
compact object, the stability of the second phase of mass
transfer and the expected spins of the massive BH in our
models for GW190814. We also compare our results to
previous studies that explored the origin of GW190814-
like events.
7.1.Kinematic Age of the HMXB 4U 1700-37
Using kinematic and distance measurements with
Gaia, V. van der Meij et al. (2021) estimated that the
HMXB 4U 1700-37 has a kinematic age of≈2.2 Myr.
This information can also be used to constrain its evo-
lutionary history. Our models for the companion star
HD 153919 agree with its estimated mass and observed
surface properties, such as its effective temperature and
luminosity. However, we find a discrepancy in the time
it takes to evolve to its current state post-SN (i.e, its
kinematic age). In our models, the companion star has
≈1 Myr left on the MS after the SN, and only≈0.7 Myr
to reach the observed position of HD 153919 on the HR
diagram. This implies a factor of 2−3×discrepancy in
the kinematic age of the system. Although unresolved,
we list a few potential explanations below–
1.Higher systemic velocity in the past:This would
imply a smaller kinematic age. This could hap-
pen if the system has slowed down over time as it
escapes the cluster potential well.
2.Larger initial donor mass:This would imply a
shorter lifetime for the progenitor of the compact
object, thereby extending the time spent by the

companion star in the post-SN phase. However,
a larger donor mass would also imply a slightly
larger pre-SN mass of the progenitor of the com-
pact object, which may be inconsistent with what
we inferred from the Monte Carlo simulations in
Section 2.
3.Smaller initial accretor mass:This would imply
a smaller mass for the star post-SN, increasing its
MS lifetime (see Appendix C). However, this could
be in tension with the estimated luminosity and
mass of the companion star, as we find that (ini-
tially) lower mass accretors are less luminous and
less massive at present day than what is inferred
from observations.
14
4.Stronger core rejuvenation:As the accretor gains
mass, its core gets rejuvenated, which increases
its MS lifetime. If rejuvenation is stronger than
implemented in our evolutionary models, it may
increase its kinematic age.
The discrepancy could also be addressed by a combi-
nation of the above factors. Previous studies have also
found a 2×discrepancy in the ages as measured from
single star evolutionary grids and kinematic ages (e.g.,
D. J. Lennon et al. 2018), and further studies are needed
to address this issue.
7.2.Rotational Velocity of HD 153919
HD 153919 is the visible companion star to the X-ray
source 4U 1700-37. As it is likely a product of past mass
transfer, it may have a high surface rotational velocity.
However, R. Hainich et al. (2020) used spectral obser-
vations and modeling to estimate an upper limit on its
projected rotational velocity of 110+30
−50km/s. This im-
plies that HD 153919 is currently sub-synchronous with
the 3.41 day orbit. However, in our models, tidal forces
are strong enough to keep the companion star sychro-
nized to the orbital period, and as a result have a large
surface rotational velocity of≈300−400 km/s. How-
ever, various studies (e.g, Y. Qin et al. 2018; L. Ma & J.
Fuller 2023) have suggested that tidal effects may not be
as large as currently implemented (following J. P. Zahn
1977 as implemented in J. R. Hurley et al. 2002). By
turning off tidal forces in our models, we find much bet-
ter agreement with the observed surface rotational ve-
locity of the companion star. In the first phase of mass
transfer prior to SN, tidal effects were crucial to keep
the accretor star from reaching critical rotation, allowing
for nearly conservative mass transfer. The truth likely
lies somewhere in between. The exact strength of tidal
forces is currently uncertain, and depends sensitively on
the internal structure of the star. The surface rotational
velocity of HD 153919 depends on a complex interplay
of AM transport during MT, the effects of time varying
tidal effects, and angular momentum lost through winds
that are not captured in full detail by our models, and
warrants further study, along with more observational
constraints.
7.3.Does the HMXB 4U 1700-37 need to form through
Case A mass transfer?
Common Envelope:Given the short period of the
HMXB today, it could also be a post-CE system. How-
ever, the companion star HD 153919 has an estimated
mass of≈40−50 M ⊙. Since it likely did not gain ap-
preciable mass during a CE phase, the progenitor of the
compact object must have been much more massive than≈40−50 M ⊙, as unstable mass transfer generally oc-
curs in systems with an asymmetric mass-ratio. For a
CE phase to be successful, the progenitor of the compact
object must have been in the post-MS phase with a well
developed core-envelope boundary. Thus, given its high
initial mass, its core would potentially be too massive
to successfully explode and leave behind a≈2 M ⊙com-
pact object as is seen in the system today. Additionally,
based on the results of our Monte Carlo simulations de-
scribed in Section 2.2, we know that the pre-SN mass
of the progenitor of the compact object was less than
13 M⊙, which is far too small of a core for a star that
had an initial mass more than≈40−50 M ⊙. Thus, a
CE phase in the past is unlikely to explain the observed
properties of the HMXB.
Case B:Another possibility is that the first phase of
MT remained stable, but occured after the MS of the
donor, that is Case B. However, this is unlikely to ex-
plain the short period of the system today. Based on
our Monte Carlo simulations, the orbital period pre-SN
must have been<10 days. For the mass range relevant
to the system of study, Case B occurs for initial periods
that are much longer than 10 days (e.g, K. Sen et al.
2023). Additionally, M. Renzo et al. (2019) showed that
for Case B mass transfer, the orbital period of the bi-
nary post-stable MT is longer than its initial period in
most cases, except for scenarios where mass transfer is
non conservative (β <0.6)andthere are extreme losses
in angular momentum (γ RLOF≥2). Therefore, we find
that it is exceedingly difficult for a binary post-Case B
MT to shrink significantly post-SN and explain the sys-
tem’s short orbital period today. Additionally, even for
Case B, the progenitor of the compact object would al-
ready have a well developed core before MT occurs, and
would be potentially too massive to successfully explode
and form a≈2 M ⊙compact object.
7.4.Explodability of first-born compact object
In Sections 3.2 and 5, we described an evolution-
ary pathway to forming highly asymmetric mass-ratio
Galactic HMXBs and GW sources. In both scenarios,
we require that the donor star in the binary successfully
explodes at the end of its life, and leaves behind a low
mass compact object which could either be a NS or a
low mass BH. Observations of the Galactic HMXB 4U
1700-37 strongly suggest that this pathway can occur in
nature, as this system, which originated in a very young
cluster, consists of a low mass compact object with a
massive stellar companion.
However, the explodability of massive stars is sensi-
tive to their pre-SN structure and past evolutionary his-
tory such as mass lost through winds or binary interac-
15
tions. Various 3D simulations of core-collapse SNe are
converging on the imporance of neutrino-driven convec-
tion in driving successful explosions (e.g, A. Burrows
& D. Vartanyan 2021; H. T. Janka 2025). However,
they are computationally intensive and can only be done
for a few progenitor models at a time, which are gen-
erally computed with 1D stellar evolution models. At
present, there is a lack of large grids of 1D models at
core-collapse, that span a wide range of single and bi-
nary star evolutionary histories, and accurately compute
through the late stages of nucelar burning that require
large nuclear networks (e.g, R. Farmer et al. 2016; M.
Renzo et al. 2024; A. Grichener et al. 2025). This has
led to the development of various simplified prescrip-
tions and explodability criterion (e.g., C. L. Fryer et al.
2012; R. A. Patton & T. Sukhbold 2020; K. Maltsev
et al. 2025) that are used in population-synthesis stud-
ies to map stars to their remnant properties, such as the
mass of the compact object, which can be tied to the
natal kick that they recieve (e.g, I. Mandel & B. M¨ uller
2020).
In our detailed binary evolution models computed
with MESA, we only evolve the stars till core helium
depletion. Therefore, we have access to the mass and
composition of the helium core, the carbon-oxygen core,
and its density profile at that time, which may al-
ready determine its explodability (e.g, E. Laplace et al.
2025). Our models have core masses that lie between
∼10−13 M ⊙. The explodability of stars with carbon-
oxygen core masses between∼7−15 M ⊙is uncertain,
and potentially stochastic (e.g, K. Maltsev et al. 2025).
If such stars do explode after losing their envelopes,
they would appear as stripped envelope SNe, with ejecta
masses of≈8−10 M ⊙. This is on the higher end
of estimated ejecta masses of observed stripped enve-
lope SNe (J. D. Lyman et al. 2016). However, recent
studies (e.g, F. R. N. Schneider et al. 2021; E. Laplace
et al. 2021; D. Vartanyan et al. 2021; R. Farmer et al.
2023) find that donors in binary system may be easier
to explode than their single star counterparts (but see
also S. Kumar & L. Boccioli 2024). Additionally, such
stripped envelope SN would have a massive compan-
ion star next to it, which may be observable with follow
up deep imaging campaigns to search for surviving com-
panions in such supernovae (e.g, E. Zapartas et al. 2017,
2026; D. Souropanis et al. 2026). On the higher mass
end, it is expected that helium cores>15 M ⊙are poten-
tially too large to lead to successful explosions (e.g,C. L.
Fryer et al. 2012; R. A. Patton & T. Sukhbold 2020; K.
Maltsev et al. 2025, but see also T. Kuroda et al. 2018;A. Burrows et al. 2023, 2024, 2025)12. Further work
is needed in 1D simulations to compute large grids of
pre-SN models with large nuclear networks that span a
wide range of single and binary evolutionary histories,
as well as a large grid of 3D simulations to better under-
stand the landscape of explodability and develop more
accurate prescriptions that can be used in population
synthesis simulations. To explicitly confirm whether the
first-born compact object in our models for highly asym-
metric mass-ratio HMXBs and GW events can be a NS
or a low mass BH, we need to evolve our models beyond
core helium depletion till core-collapse, which we defer
to future work.
7.5.Spin of the massive BH
In addition to the masses of the compact objects and
the distance to the source, the GW signal also encodes
information on their spins. While it is difficult to mea-
sure individual spins, the GW detectors are sensitive to
χeff, a mass-weighted combination of the two spins pro-
jected onto the orbital angular momentum. For highly
asymmetric mass-ratio systems, wherem 1is much larger
thanm 2, the GW signal provides a strong constraint on
the spin of the massive BH. This is true for GW190814,
where the spin of the primary BH is tightly constrained
to be≤0.07 (R. Abbott et al. 2020).
Spins of compact objects are closely tied to the evolu-
tionary history of their progenitors, such as the angular
momentum (AM) transport between their cores and en-
velopes, the mass and angular momentum gained or lost
through winds and binary interactions, and also the ef-
fects of tides in close binaries. Based on our current
understanding of AM transport within stars, it is ex-
pected that the first-born BHs are born with negligible
spin (e.g, J. Fuller & L. Ma 2019). However, the progen-
itor of the second born BH may get spun up before its
death through tidal interactions with its companion (e.g,
S. S. Bavera et al. 2020, see also K. Sen et al. 2025a).
In our evolutionary scenario for GW190814-like sys-
tems, we find that the massive BH is the second born
compact object. To first order, if one assumes efficient
tidal locking, it may be expected to have a large spin,
which would be in tension with the measured low spin
of the massive BH in GW190814. However, detailed nu-
merical studies of tides in WR+BH binaries (L. Ma &
J. Fuller 2023) find that spin up through tides is not
be as efficient as previously assumed. The strength of
tidal forces scales asq2, thus it also gets progressively

cores can potentially explode as well (D. M. Siegel et al. 2022;
O. Gottlieb et al. 2025).
16
smaller as the mass-ratio of the binary decreases. Ad-
ditionally, our models undergo a CE phase towards the
end of core-helium burning, with only≈0.03 Myr left
till helium depletion in our fiducial model. Therefore,
even if we disregard the damping of tidal forces due to
the asymmetric mass-ratio of the system, there is likely
not enough time for tides to spin up the star’s remannt
core prior to the end of its life. Thus, we expect the
massive BH to not have any significant spin, and em-
phasize that the measured negligible spin of the massive
BH in GW190814 need not imply that it is the first-born
compact object in the binary.
7.6.Stability of second phase of mass transfer
In our fiducial model for both the HMXB 4U 1700-37
and GW190814, we assume that mass transfer from the
companion star to the first-born compact object is un-
stable, and leads to a CE phase. This is primarily based
on the extreme mass-ratio of the binary (e.g, J. S. W.
Claeys et al. 2014; K. Pavlovskii et al. 2017). We also
find that the mass transfer rates during this phase ex-
ceed 0.1 M ⊙/yr, which has been used as threshold indi-
cating the onset of dynamical instability (e.g., T. Fragos
et al. 2023). In our default setup, we assume that mass
lost from the system carries with it the specific angu-
lar momentum of the accretor’s center of mass. How-
ever, recently A. Olejak et al. (2025) suggested that mass
transfer in such extreme mass-ratio binaries may remain
stable if mass transfer is assumed to be non conservative,
and the mass that is lost from the system carries away
the specific angular momentum of the donor’s center of
mass. In such a scenario, the binary widens during mass
transfer, allowing it to remain stable. On implementing
such a setup in our binary evolution models, we find that
although mass transfer remains stable and avoids a CE
phase, the orbit of the binary widens to≈80 R ⊙. This
is large enough such that when the double compact bi-
nary forms, it takes much longer to merge through a GW
driven inspiral than the age of the Universe. Therefore,
we do not expect such a pathway to contribute to the
formation of highly asymmetric mass-ratio GW events.
However, it may play a role in the future evolution of
the HMXB 4U 1700-37/ HD 153919, and further work
is needed to determine the stability of mass transfer in
such extreme mass-ratio binaries.
Additionally, M. Quast et al. (2019) showed that mass-
transfer in HMXBs could remain stable on a nuclear
timescale if the donor star has a steep H/He gradient
beneath its surface. They suggest that the presence of a
gradient can stabilize mass transfer upto mass-ratios of
≈1/20. However, for the gradient to be revealed at the
surface, the star must have lost a significant amount ofmass in the past. To explain this, M. Quast et al. (2019)
suggest that the HMXB phase may have been preceded
by a prior CE phase that strips its envelope, and reveals
the H/He gradient. Such stripped stars would have dif-
ferent surface abundances and spectra than predicted by
our models where the companion star was an accretor in
the past. In such a scenario, it may also be a challenge to
explain the presence of the low mass compact object in
the HMXB 4U 1700-37, although further observations
of this system and HD 153919 in particular will help
distinguish between different formation pathways.
7.7.Comparison to previous work
Various studies have aimed at understanding the po-
tential formation pathways for GW190814-like systems
(e.g, M. Zevin et al. 2020; I. Mandel et al. 2021; M.
Arca Sedda 2021; W. Lu et al. 2021; I. Maga˜ na Hernan-
dez & K. Breivik 2025). In the context of isolated binary
evolution, such studies have focused on the mass of the
secondary compact object, and/or the mass-ratio of the
event. The majority of these studies have only explored
these questions using rapid binary population synthe-
sis techniques. In particular, M. Zevin et al. (2020)
find two potential scenarios for forming such systems,
one where the low-mass compact object forms first, and
another where the larger BH forms first. The evolu-
tionary scenario that we demonstrate in this work with
detailed binary evolution models is qualitatively simi-
lar to the former where the first born compact object
requires a large natal kick to widen the orbit post-SN.
However, they find that the rates of such systems are a
couple of orders of magnitude lower than the LVK esti-
mated rate of GW190814-like events. Motivated by the
existence of a low mass compact object in the highly
asymmetric mass-ratio Galactic HMXB 4U 1700-37, we
showed that the former scenario can occur in nature and
demonstrated its feasibility with detailed binary evolu-
tion models (althought see Z. Xing et al. 2025). The
same formation pathway was also found by I. Mandel
et al. (2021), but required Hertzprung-Gap donors to
survive the CE phase. This may not be possible, given
the high envelope binding energies while crossing the
HG. Additionally, as discussed in Section 5, we find that
star should be ascending the RSG branch and nearing
the end of its core-helium burning phase for a successful
CE phase.
8.CONCLUSION
The catalog of GW events from compact binary merg-
ers is expected to rapidly grow in the coming years. Un-
derstanding where, and how these sources form is a key
goal for studies of massive (and binary) star evolution.
17
However, the masses and spins of the compact objects
as inferred from the GW data are often insufficient to
infer their formation history, which can involve many
intermediate stages. This is particularly relevant for
the astrophysical interpretation of the (numerous) ex-
ceptional GW events that may be outliers to the rest
of the GW population, which is bound to increase as
the catalog size increases. In such situations, it can be
beneficial to understand the origins of the (numerous)
earlier stages in the evolution of massive stars in bina-
ries. Such systems abound in the local Universe, such
as Algols (e.g, K. Sen et al. 2025b), WR+O systems
(e.g, D. Vanbeveren et al. 1998; M. Nuijten & G. Nele-
mans 2025), O+BH binaries (e.g, T. Shenar et al. 2022,
see K. Deshmukh et al. 2026 for a potential candidate),
HXMBs (e.g, F. Fortin et al. 2023; D. Kaltenbrunner
et al. 2026), DNSs (e.g, A. Vigna-G´ omez et al. 2018),
companions to stripped envelope supernovae (e.g, E. Za-
partas et al. 2017, 2026; D. Souropanis et al. 2026) etc.
They offer a treasure trove of observational constraints
that can be utilized to understand their evolutionary
history, which are inaccessible when solely studying GW
sources.
We demonstrate this approach for GW190814, which,
with aq≈0.1 remains the most asymmetric mass-
ratio compact binary merger observed by the LVK detec-
tors. Although there have been several proposed forma-
tion pathways for this event, its origin remains unclear.
Leveraging the highly asymmetric mass-ratio Galactic
HMXB 4U 1700-37, we find that:
•Utilizing several observables such as its orbital
properties, kinematics, and local environment, we
use Monte Carlo simulations to reconstruct the
state of the HMXb 4U 1700-37/ HD 153919 pre-
SN. We found that the progenitor of the compact
object had a pre-SN mass<13 M ⊙, and the bi-
nary had a pre-SN orbital period<10 days. This
strongly suggests that the system underwent a
phase of mass transfer in the past, during the Main
Sequence of the primary (case A).
•We construct detailed binary evolution models
withMESAto explain the evolutionary history of
the HMXB, and find that conservative mass trans-
fer on the Main Sequence (Case A), along with a
directed natal kick can explain the observed prop-
erties of the system today.
•We demonstrate that that the HMXB is unlikely
to form a GW source in the future. It will likely
undergo a failed CE phase in the future due to
the high binding energy of the companion star’senvelope, in agreement with previous work (e.g,
P. Podsiadlowski 1994; E. P. J. van den Heuvel
et al. 2017; T. M. Tauris et al. 2017; R. Hainich
et al. 2020).
•By computing additional models at lower metallic-
ity, we show that a similar evolutionary pathway
can also form highly asymmetric mass-ratio GW
sources like GW190814. The first phase of mass
transfer remains stable and conservative, which in-
verts the mass-ratio of the binary. For a successful
CE phase in the future, we find that the first born
compact object must receive a strong natal kick
(≳100 km/s) to widen the orbit post-SN. This al-
lows for the CE phase to occur when the compan-
ion star is a RSG with a loosely bound convective
envelope that is easier to eject.
•In both scenarios, we find that the first-born com-
pact object is the lower mass compact object, that
is a NS or a low mass BH. For the systems that
form a GW source, the massive BH is the second
born compact object, and we expect it to have
negligible spin, in agreement with measured spin
of the primary (more massive) BH in GW190814.
•Utilizing the fact that there exist two highly asym-
metric Galactic HMXBs, we estimate the local
rate of highly asymmetric GW190814-like events
to be≈0.5 Gpc−3yr−1, which is in broad agree-
ment with GW observations.
As the ground-based GW detectors rapidly increase
the sample of detected events, it will enable a better
characterization of highly asymmetric mass-ratio BBH
or NSBH systems (e.g, Z. Xing et al. 2024). It will allow
us to understand the nature of individual events, as well
as explore correlations in their mass, spin, and redshift
distributions. Such studies could potentially distinguish
between the different formation pathways proposed for
the formation of such systems. Additionally, several on-
going or future surveys such asGaia(e.g, Gaia Col-
laboration et al. 2023; K. El-Badry 2024b), LSST (e.g,
K. M. Hambleton et al. 2023), Roman (e.g, C. Y. Lam
et al. 2023), eROSITA (e.g, A. Merloni et al. 2024) will
rapidly increase the sample of products of massive bi-
nary evolution in various stages. These systems provide
a local anchors to understand various uncertainties in
the evolution of massive stars and compact objects in
binaries, and can be utilized as a bridge to understand
the origin of GW sources.

B.RESOLUTION TESTS
To ensure that our results are robust to the choice of spatial and temporal resolution inMESA, we repeated our
fiducial binary evolution calculations by increasing the number of mesh points, i.e. decreasingmesh delta coeffand
mesh time coeffby a factor of 2/3. In Fig 7, we show that the evolution of the donor and accretor stars on the
HR diagram for our fiducial models to explain the evolutionary history of the HMXB 4U 1700-37 (left panel) and
a GW190814-like system (right panel). The blue and red solid colors represent the default resolution for the donor
and accretor, where we havemesh delta coeff≡∆ x= 1 andmesh time coeff≡∆ t= 0.8. The cyan and pink
dashed lines represent higher resolution models, where we decrease both ∆ xand ∆ tby a factor of 2/3. We find
that the evolutionary tracks of both the donor and accretor stars are nearly identical for both choices of resolution,
demonstrating that our results are robust and there is convergence in the numerical treatment of binary evolution in
MESA. The number of zones in our accretor models for the HMXB 4U 1700-37 are≈1600 and≈2400 for the fiducial
and high resolution runs, while the number of timesteps are≈67250 and≈68600, respectively. The accretor models
for the formation of a GW190814-like system have≈1700 and≈2500 zones for the fiducial and high resolution runs,
while the number of timesteps are≈14500 and≈17500, respectively.
C.VARIATIONS IN INITIAL CONDITIONS
To demonstrate that our binary evolution models for the formation of the HMXB 4U 1700-37/ HD 153919 are robust
against small variations in initial parameters, we compute a small grid where we vary the initial mass of the accretor
star from the value chosen for the fiducial model. Their evolution on the HR diagram is shown in Fig 8. All models
follow a similar evolutionary track as the fiducial model. Depending on the mass of the accretor, the tracks shift up
or down in luminosity. Additionally, lower mass accretors also spend more time on the Main Sequence post-SN, which
may help address the discrepancy in the kinematic age of the system as discussed in Section 7.1. Our models can be
further constrained with more observational studies of the surface properties and the distance to HD 153919, which
will help resolve its exact position on the HR diagram.
