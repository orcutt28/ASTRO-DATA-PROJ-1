ABSTRACT
Double white dwarfs (DWDs) are by far the most common compact binaries in the Milky Way,
are important low-frequency gravitational-wave sources, and in some cases merge to become Type Ia
supernovae. So far, no DWD has been identified solely through relativistic Doppler beaming, even
though the beaming amplitude directly relates to the radial velocity semi-amplitude. In this work,
we initiate a comprehensive binary population synthesis using SeBa and incorporate the resulting
binaries into a tripartite Galaxy model. Our proof-of-concept simulations demonstrate that the Vera
C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) can reliably recover relatively bright
(r≲20mag) unequal-mass binaries in compact orbits with P≈10–600 minutes with moderate
to high inclinations. We find that LSST can detect at least 287 short-period DWDs, of which 47
are LISA-detectable gravitational wave sources. LSST lightcurves allow us to readily determine the
period and fully characterize the orbit, in contrast with the challenges of orbit determination for
DWDsinspectroscopicsearches. Theformationofunequalmass, short-periodDWDsstronglydepends
on the assumptions regarding the mass-transfer phases during binary population synthesis, and the
total number and characteristics of Doppler-beamed DWD systems observed in LSST will provide
new tests of models of stellar binary evolution. Here, we lay the foundation for the comprehensive
integration of synthetic Galactic binary population into realistic LSST survey simulations, thereby
enabling quantitative forecasts of the number and characteristics of any binary sub-population during
the LSST era.

1.INTRODUCTION
With nearly half of all stars in the Galaxy in binaries,
stellar binary evolution plays a key role in shaping the
visible universe. The interactions and mergers within
stellar binary systems lead to some of the most excit-
ing astrophysical transients (B. Paczyński 1971; F. K.
Röpke & O. De Marco 2023; P. Marchant & J. Boden-
steiner 2024). The mergers of two White Dwarfs (WDs)
may dominate the production of Type Ia supernovae
(e.g., I. Iben & A. V. Tutukov 1984; R. F. Webbink
1984; D. Maoz et al. 2014; A. J. Ruiter & I. R. Seiten-
zahl 2025), a cornerstone of modern cosmology (A. G.
Riess et al. 1998; S. Perlmutter et al. 1999). Compact
Email: gadaman1@jh.edubinaries are sources of gravitational waves (GW) (G.
Nelemans et al. 2001), and double WD (DWD) binaries
are expected to be the most dominant Galactic source of
GW detectable by upcoming space based GW detector
Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA); G. Nele-
mans et al. 2001a; T. Kupfer et al. 2018; V. Korol et al.
2017; H.-M. Jin et al. 2024).
Discovery of DWDs in large-scale spectroscopic sur-
veys such as Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is ineffi-
cientduetothetimeintensivemulti-epochspectroscopic
observations and low DWD binary fraction of≈10%
(C. Badenes & D. Maoz 2012; D. Maoz & N. Hallak-
oun 2017; G. Adamane Pallathadka et al. 2025). So
far, only around 400 close DWDs (optically unresolved)
have been spectroscopically confirmed (J. Munday et al.
2024). However, only a fraction of these have measuredarXiv:2602.13137v1  [astro-ph.SR]  13 Feb 2026

periods, and an even smaller fraction with compact or-
bits with periods of few hours. The discovery of short-
period DWDs in large-scale photometric surveys such
as Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; E. C. Bellm et al.
2019; R. Dekany et al. 2020) and Transiting Exoplanet
Survey Satellite (TESS; G. R. Ricker et al. 2015) is pos-
sible only in edge-on systems that show eclipses due to
the compact radii of WDs. Low-mass short-period WD
binaries can be identified due to tidal deformations and
the resulting lightcurve variations (J. J. Hermes et al.
2014), while binaries detected through reflection effects
require an exceedingly hot companion (e.g., T. Kupfer
et al. 2019, 2020; V. Schaffenroth et al. 2022)
Most well-known close WD binaries have been identi-
fied through effects that are highly dependent on geome-
try or temperature (I. Iben & A. V. Tutukov 1986; L. R.
Yungelson et al. 1994; G. Nelemans et al. 2001b; Z. Han
1998; S. Toonen et al. 2012, 2017). Recently, L. Hell-
ström et al. (2025) show that eccentric, tight DWs form
through dynamical interactions in dense stellar clusters,
not in the field. While rare—about10−15in the Milky
Way—they can produce detectable GWs. These bina-
ries offer a chance to independently measure their host
distances clusters (see, B. Willems et al. 2007).
An alternative pathway to discovering short-period
DWDs is through the Doppler beaming effect, but it
requires extremely precise photometry. Doppler beam-
ing is a special-relativistic variation in the observed flux
due to the time-varying velocity of the source relative to
the observer (S. Zucker et al. 2007). Space missions such
asCoRoTandKeplerhave already demonstrated that
Doppler beaming can be utilized to detect non-eclipsing
compact binaries and to directly infer their radial veloc-
ity (RV) semi-amplitudes from photometric data (e.g.,
T. Mazeh & S. Faigler 2010; P. Eigmüller et al. 2018; C.
Zheng et al. 2024). A. Shporer et al. (2010) reported the
first ground-based measurement of Doppler beaming in
aDWDwithorbitalperiodof5.6hrandbeamingampli-
tude of only 3 mmag. Typically, Doppler beaming effect
is only of the order of a few milli-mags or less, and WDs
are faint. Consequently, to the best of our knowledge,
no DWD binary has been discovered through Doppler
beaming alone.
With the upcoming wide-field time-domain surveys
with Vera Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space
and Time (LSST; LSST Science Collaboration et al.
2009, 2017; Ž. Ivezić et al. 2019; N. J. Fantin et al.
2020), the single visit photometric error can be as low
as 5 millimags, which is comparable to Doppler beam-
ing amplitudes. These amplitudes are readily measur-
able when data from hundreds of visits are aggregated.
LSST expands beyond targeted follow-up searches andcovers the entire Southern sky, and thus we are finally
at the precipice of detecting binaries through Doppler
beamingalone. Thissamplewillcomplementtheseveral
hundred DWDs that will be discovered in LSST using
eclipses (V. Korol et al. 2017; H.-M. Jin et al. 2024), will
vastly increase the number of short-period DWDs, and
contribute to the growing sample of LISA verification
binaries – DWDs that are detectable by LISA as indi-
vidual sources of low-frequency GWs (E. Finch et al.
2023).
This study is similar to the works of V. Korol et al.
(2017) and H.-M. Jin et al. (2024), which estimated
the number of eclipsing binaries detectable by LSST.
We integrate binary population synthesis with a realis-
tic model of the Milky Way to predict the number and
characteristics of DWDs that LSST can detect through
Doppler beaming, employing the SeBa rapid binary evo-
lution code (G. Nelemans et al. 2001b; S. Toonen et al.
2012; N. J. Fantin et al. 2020). These systems are incor-
porated into a three-component Galactic model, encom-
passing the thin disk, the thick disk, and the bulge. We
utilize a time-dependent star formation history and as-
sign sky positions and distances accordingly. For these
DWDs, we generate LSST light curves based on the
baseline ten-year observing strategy and assess the ef-
ficiency of Doppler beaming in enabling the discovery of
DWDs. Our primary objective is to evaluate whether
LSST can identify approximately∼102DWDs through
beaming and develop a strategy to efficiently identify
DWDs in LSST with minimal false-positives.
The paper is organized as follows: in Sec. 2, we de-
scribe the Galactic DWD population synthesis and spa-
tial distribution; in Sec. 3, we present our LSST ob-
serving and period-recovery simulations; in Sec. 4 and
Sec. 5, we summarize our main results and discuss their
implications for DWD demographics and future GW ob-
servations; andinSec.6weprovideourfinalconclusions.
Orbital inclinations are defined relative to the plane of
the sky.
2.SIMULATING GALACTIC DWD POPULATION
2.1.Binary Population Synthesis
To simulate the DWD formation in the Galaxy, we
use the rapid binary population synthesis code SeBa
(G. Nelemans et al. 2001b; S. Toonen & G. Nelemans
2013). For the mass-transfer phases in binary evolution,
we follow theγαprescription and the parameter val-
ues assumed by S. Toonen & G. Nelemans (2013). The
primary star mass is drawn from the Kroupa mass func-
tion between 0.9 – 10 M ⊙with solar metallicity. The
secondary to primary mass ratio is drawn uniformly be-
tween(0,1]. Thesemi-majoraxisisdrawnfromapower-
3
law distribution with index -1 between 0 and106R⊙,
such that the semi-major axis distribution is flat in log
scale. The eccentricity is drawn from a uniform distri-
bution, which has been favored over the thermal distri-
bution for close binaries (D. Raghavan et al. 2010; M.
Moe & R. Di Stefano 2017; H.-C. Hwang et al. 2022;
Y. Wu et al. 2025). We also repeated the analysis for
a thermal distribution of eccentricity but found negligi-
ble difference in our final result, which is likely because
the close binaries that form short-period DWDs quickly
circularize, making the initial eccentricity largely incon-
sequential.
2.2.Galactic Distribution of Stars
We simulate the Galactic stellar population by divid-
ing the Galaxy into the thin disk, the thick disk, and
the bulge, as described in Appendix A. For the thin and
thick disk, we model the star formation following N. J.
Fantinetal.(2019)andapproximateitusingclosedform
functions, resulting in the star formation rate (SFR) as
a function of time shown in Fig. 1. The current thin disk
SFR is 2.6 M ⊙/yr, and the peak of the thick disk SFR at
9 M⊙/yr and 0.6 Gyr width. For the bulge, we assume
a Gaussian distribution centered at 4.5 Gyr (8.5 Gyr in
lookback time) and 1.5 Gyr width. The normalization
is chosen such that total bulge mass matches the results
of T. C. Licquia & J. A. Newman (2015). We obtain a
total present-day stellar mass of4.73×1010M⊙.
We split the age of the Galaxy intodt= 0.5Gyr bins
and calculate the mass of formed stars in each bin for
each component. We assume half of all visible stars are
in binaries, or an initial binary fraction of 0.5, consis-
tent with past binary population synthesis studies (S.
Toonen et al. 2012; A. Lamberts et al. 2019; K. Breivik
et al. 2020). M. Moe & R. Di Stefano (2017) find the bi-
nary fraction to be less than 50% and dependent on the
primary mass, and a fraction of stars to be in triples and
quadruples. However, we only simulate binaries follow-
ing the binary population synthesis simulations in the
literature and, thus, set a constant binary fraction of 0.5
for simplicity. Under this assumption, the total mass of
stars in primaries is the same as the total mass of sin-
gle stars in the galaxy. Assuming a uniform mass-ratio
for the secondary, over a large sample (which is always
satisfied at galactic scales) the average mass ratio is 0.5.
Thus, for the entire Galactic stellar population 40% of
the mass is in single stars, 40% of the mass is in the pri-
mary stars of the binaries, and finally 20% of the mass is
in the secondaries. The 40% of the mass in the primaries
is distributed between [0.1,100] M ⊙based on Kroupa
mass function. By integrating the Kroupa mass func-
tion (or equivalently, by drawing a large mock sample),we find that nearly half of the total mass is contained in
our simulation range between [0.9,10] M ⊙– i.e., in the
types of stars that can lead to the formation of WDs
in binaries over cosmic time. Thus, we expect 20% of
the total stellar mass is assigned to be in such primaries
in our simulation. Further, the mean mass of the stars
sampled between [0.9,10] M ⊙is 2.11 M ⊙. IfdM T(t)is
the total stellar mass formed in a time bin[t, t+dt], then
we expect nearlydN(t)= (0.2dM T(t))/2.11 number of
such binaries. For each star, we assign a formation time
uniformly within the time bin[t, t+dt]with a resolution
of 10 million years. The orbital inclination for each bi-
nary is drawn from a sinusoidal distribution, consistent
with randomly oriented orbits.
Simulating the entire Galactic population, which
amounts to nearly 4 billion binaries in the range of pa-
rameters that is of interest to us, is computationally
expensive. The stellar populations of a given age in dif-
ferent regions of the Galaxy are identical in our model.
Thus, we simulate 50 million binaries in SeBa, with stel-
lar evolution time inferred based on the star formation
distribution described above. We then assign coordi-
nates and formation time to 1/4th of the total Galac-
tic population, or nearly 1 billion binaries and resam-
ple the 50 million simulated binaries to a much bigger
sample of 1 billion. While the same DWD will get as-
signed multiple times in the final sample, these copies
will be distributed across the Galaxy and still give us
a well-sampled population. Finally, any number that is
inferred from this population is multiplied by 4 to get
the total realistic number estimates.
2.3.Synthetic photometry
We use synthetic WD colors to simulate the observed
photometry (P. M. Kowalski & D. Saumon 2006; P.-
E. Tremblay et al. 2011; S. Blouin et al. 2018; A. Bé-
dard et al. 2020)5. LSST filters are well approximated
by SDSS and Pan-STARRS optical filters, and we use
SDSSu-band absolute magnitude to represent the LSST
uband, and Pan-STARRSgrizyabsolute magnitudes
for the LSSTgrizybands. The absolute magnitude of
the binary is computed from the sum of fluxes from both
WDs. Taking into the account the dust extinctionA b
(calculated as described in Appendix B) for a DWD at
distanced kpc, the observed magnitude in a bandbcan
be written as:

For this work, we limit our analysis to targets brighter
than 20th magnitude. Such WDs are in theGaiafoot-
print with good distance estimates, and we use the
nearly complete sample of WDs forG <20mag by
N. P. Gentile Fusillo et al. (2021) to estimate the false-
positive rate. Our work can be extended once the WD
populationisbettercharacterizedatfaintermagnitudes.
We also discard systems brighter than the 17th magni-
tude as they are near the saturation limit of the LSST
detector.
3.LIGHTCURVE SIMULATION AND PERIOD
RECOVERY
3.1.Simulating LSST lightcurves
To simulate the LSST cadence, we use the 10-year
simulated LSST observations with the baseline strategy
baseline_v5.0.0_10yrs6. For each DWD, we select
all fields that are within the LSST FOV (1.75◦radius).
A source in LSST footprint typically gets about 700 ob-
servations with a minimum time gap of 30 minutes be-
tween exposures.

system. The single-exposure photometric error exceeds
the Doppler beaming amplitude and is insufficient to de-
tect photometric variation. However, over the lifespan
of LSST such a system will be observed up to approxi-
mately 700 times covering several thousand orbits. Per-
forming a periodogram search has a similar to effect to
stacking the observations at the same phase, and we can
use this technique to check whether the system will be
visible to LSST as a binary. Stacking 70 exposures, or
10% of all observations, reduces the photometric error
as shown in Fig. 2. Thus, in the phase-folded lightcurve
the Doppler beaming amplitude can be greater than
the photometric error, and, under favorable conditions,

3.2.Period Recovery:
WeusetheacceleratedLomb-Scargleperiodogramim-
plemented byNIFTyinastropyto find the best-fit pe-
riod (N. R. Lomb 1976; J. D. Scargle 1982; L. H. Gar-
rison et al. 2024). We perform the periodogram search
for periods between 10 minutes and 50 hours, a typi-
cal range of periods expected for photometric variation
in WDs. The Doppler beaming amplitude can vary for
different bands, and some bands, such as ther-band,
receive much more observations than others. We com-
bine data from all the photometric bands into a singlelightcurve. These differences in amplitudes and the ef-
fect of combining them can be seen as tracks with dif-
fering amplitudes in the lightcurves shown in Fig. 3. In
principle, performing a multi-band Lomb-Scargle peri-
odogram will produce better results (see, e.g, J. T. Van-
derPlas & Ž. Ivezić 2015). However, we find this compu-
tationally impractical and suggest it only for improving
systems that are first identified as varying.
We compute the false-alarm probability inastropy
which is the probability that a noisy dataset with the
same cadence produces a periodic power as strong as
the best-fit period (R. V. Baluev 2008). We classify
systems with false alarm probability less than10−5as
binary candidates.Gaiahas observed around 200,000
WDs brighter than the 20th magnitude in optical band,
which is a nearly complete sample (N. P. Gentile Fusillo
et al. 2021). Only about half of these are in the southern
hemisphereandfallintheLSSTfootprint. Afalsealarm
probability of 0.001% implies that we expect around one
WD to be incorrectly classified as a binary. We find that
increasing this cutoff does not significantly increase the
number of DWDs detected, while the false positives in-
crease rapidly. Considering systems beyond 20th mag-
nitude can also increase the number of DWDs detected,
but at the cost of increased number of false-positives. A
better characterization of LSST noise behavior in real
observations, combined with simulations of the single
WD population, will allow us to make a less conserva-
tive estimate on the number of DWDs detected in the
future.
4.RESULTS
We repeat the lightcurve simulation and period recov-
ery ten times for different random seeds to ensure that
the results are largely independent of the choice of the
initial seed. Taking the average of ten runs, we find that
LSST can detect at least 287 DWD binary candidates
using Doppler beaming alone, of which at most a couple
will be false-positives. We find that for a vast majority
of these we can recover the true period, although there
can be secondary peaks confounding the period deter-
mination. In Fig. 3 we show four different examples of
period recovery. The systems classified as binaries show
a clear peak in the power spectrum, and the best-fit
model closely matches the simulated model. As the false
alarm probability increases, the amplitude of variation
decreases and the binned lightcurve becomes noisier.

ble 1.
5.DICUSSION
Fig. 4 shows the inter-dependencies between various
parameters of the detected DWDs. We find that most
DWDs have a He-core WD companion, consistent with
observations (W. R. Brown et al. 2020; A. Kosakowski
et al. 2023; G. Adamane Pallathadka et al. 2025). The
distribution of masses and temperatures makes it clear
that Doppler beaming is strongest in systems where one
of the two stars dominates the total luminosity, such
that the Doppler beaming of one does not offset the
Doppler beaming of the other. We find that shorter
orbital periods are preferred but with a long tail, and
with longer orbital periods requiring larger inclinations
and brighter systems, as expected.
To illustrate the multi-dimensional selection function
that will influence the LSST detections, in Fig. 5 wecompare the period, total mass, and the mass ratio of
detected DWDs to the rest of the DWDs withr <20
mag and orbital period less than 10 hours. The pe-
riod distribution shows that short-period binaries with
orbital periods shorter than 5 hours are preferentially
selected – the beaming amplitude is proportional to RV
semi-amplitude which decreases at longer orbital peri-
ods. From the mass ratio distribution, it is clear that
Doppler beaming detections are biased to unequal-mass
binaries. This is primarily because the WDs in equal
mass binaries will have similar RV semi-amplitudes, and
due to their similar sizes, they are more likely to have
comparable luminosities. Thus, the Doppler beaming
of one offsets the other (see, Equation 2). Also, at the
same orbital period and same total system mass, the
lower mass WD in unequal mass binaries has a larger
RV semi-amplitude than either WDs in equal mass bi-
naries, leadingtoalargerbeamingamplitude. Thispref-
erence for unequal mass binaries leads to a narrow peak
in total mass around 1 M ⊙, since extremely low mass
and extremely high mass systems are more likely to be
produced by equal mass binaries.
We can make use of these selection preferences to ex-
plore the mass-transfer phases of compact binary evo-
lution. The mass-ratio distribution of DWDs strongly
depends on assumptions regarding the mass-transfer
phases during binary evolution. Some binary popula-

nals. Thus, by comparing the total number of binaries
detected through Doppler beaming in LSST and their
characteristics with the binary population synthesis re-
sults, we can constrain the binary evolution models.
Fig. 6 shows that only systems within≈500 pc are
recovered, which is a consequence of our magnitude cut-
off (r <20mag). We find that most detected DWDs
have ages around 6 Gyrs, indicating a thin disk origin,
and a broad tail indicating a thick disk origin. Thick
disk stars would originate with metallicity lower thanthe assumed solar value and consequently lead to WD
masses greater than those with solar metallicity progen-
itors (A. D. Romero et al. 2015). Thus, our work likely
underestimates the number of massive WDs in binaries.
Given the typical distances, we do not expect any stars
to be located in the central bulge. The age-distance
distribution shows a feeble tail, with stars further away
being younger – a consequence of them being hotter and
brighter. These DWDs are distributed throughout the
Galaxy, although there is a slight preference towards the
Galactic center as seen in Fig. 7.

tentially be contaminated by several types of interesting

ationsthatmaybeconfusedwiththeperiodicvariability
of Doppler-beamed binaries. However, pulsating WDs
are restricted to a narrow range of stellar temperatures
and to periods within a couple of hours (V. Van Grootel
et al. 2012). In addition to pulsating WDs, reflectionbinaries and ellipsoidal variables can produce similar si-
nusoidally varying lightcurves (J. J. Hermes et al. 2014).
Both these effects originate due to binary nature of the
system and are equally interesting as Doppler beaming
to detect short period DWDs. The color information
provided by LSST and the spectroscopic followups will
be helpful in distinguishing between these effects.
6.CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we have developed a forward-modeling
framework to predict the binary population of DWDs
thattheLSSTcandetectthroughDopplerbeaming. We
start with a large SeBa binary population synthesis run,
which provides the intrinsic properties and evolutionary
histories of millions of binaries over 13 Gyrs. These sys-
tems are then embedded in a three-component Milky
Way model (thin disk, thick disk, and bulge) with a
time-dependentstarformationhistoryinspiredbyrecent
measurements of star formation rate. Together with a
realistic spatial distribution and dust extinction model,
this approach yields a synthetic present-day Galactic
DWD population with distances and physical param-
eters suitable for comparison with observations, LSST
positions, and magnitudes. With such a sample, we sim-
ulate their lightcurves including Doppler beaming and
attempt to recover the binaries. We find that this is a
promisingwaytoexpandthecatalogofcloseDWDbina-
ries and find that we can expect to observe at least 287
short-period DWDs with a median period of 4 hours, of
which 47 will be LISA verification binaries. Once such
systems are identified, inexpensive follow-up campaign
of couple of exposures per target will be sufficient to de-
termine the source of photometric variation and to clas-
sify the system as a binary, with a well-measured orbital
period using the lightcurve. Observing and characteriz-
ing this population of binaries will help us answer some
ofthelong-standingproblemsinstellarbinaryevolution.

APPENDIX
A.STRUCTURE OF THE GALAXY
We consider a realistic Galactic model by splitting the Galaxy into three components: thin disk, thick disk, and
bulge (N. Frankel et al. 2018; T. Wagg et al. 2022). Each component is modeled using cylindrical coordinates(r, ϕ, z).
1. Dependence onr: Assuming exponentially decaying surface brightness profile of galaxies, the probability density
distribution of stars is given by:
p(r) =r
r2sexp
−r
rs
,(A1)
wherer sis the scale-length and varies for each Galactic components. This is a gamma distribution with shape
parameter 2 and scale parameterr s. We make use ofscipy.stats.gammato draw samples from this distribution.
2. Dependence onz: The exponentially decaying surface brightness profile assumption results in a probability
density distribution ofz-coordinate of stars give by:
p(z) =1
zsexp
−|z|
zs
,(A2)
wherez sis the scale-length. This is a gamma distribution with shape parameter 1 and scale parameterz s. We
again make use ofscipy.stats.gammato draw samples from this distribution.
3. Dependence onϕ: The angular component is uniformly assigned between [0,2π].
The full 3D probability distribution is the product of the three probability densities. The different scale-lengths
are summarized in Table 2. The coordinates(r, ϕ, z)are converted to Galactocentric coordinates(x, y, z)≡
(rcosϕ, rsinϕ, z), which are then converted to (RA,dec,d) usingastropy. For the Galactocentric coordinates, we
use theastropydefault definition with the Earth situated along negativex-axis i.eϕ=180 degrees.

B.DUST EXTINCTION
Following the same prescription as A. Sandage (1972) and G. Nelemans et al. (2004), we assume a uniform sheet of
dust along the Galactic plane with density in thez-direction proportional to the stellar density of the thin disk, with
scale heightz s= 0.3kpc. This approximation works well when the observed stars are at a distance smaller than the
scale-lengths in Table 2, which is true for WDs withr≲20mag. Under this assumption, extinction can be written as
the ratio of the total column density of dust towards a star with Galactic coordinates(l, b)at distancedand a star
along the same direction at infinite distance:

This equation becomes ill-defined for|b| ≪1when we use a realistic map forA V(l, b,∞)and thus we set
b=max(|b|,1◦)which makes the function well behaved for all angles. We obtainA V(l, b,∞)from 2D dust ex-
tinction map by D. J. Schlegel et al. (1998), implemented industmapspackage (G. M. Green 2018). To con-
vertA Vto appropriate babd-passes, we use the result from E. F. Schlafly & D. P. Finkbeiner (2011) and get
