ABSTRACT
Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars have recently attracted attention as possible drivers of early chemical en-
richment, including the production of fluorine, whose nucleosynthetic origin remains debated. To test
the contribution of massive stars to fluorine production in the early Universe, we conducted Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 5 spectroscopy of the HF(1–0) absorption line toward a
dusty star-forming galaxy atz= 6.024. This galaxy has a known gas-phase metallicity and is too
young for low-mass AGB stars to have contributed significantly, providing a clean environment to iso-
late massive-star yields. We do not detect significant HF absorption (∼2σ) and derive a conservative
5σupper limit ofN HF/NH2<2.2×10−9. This limit is about an order of magnitude below typical local
measurements, indicating inefficient fluorine enrichment∼0.9 Gyr after the Big Bang. Comparison
with chemical evolution models shows that our constraint is consistent with scenarios without WR
yields at this epoch. Expanding the sample of HF absorption measurements in high-redshift galaxies
with well-characterized metallicities will be crucial for tracing the onset of WR enrichment and fluorine
production across cosmic time.

1.INTRODUCTION
Recent discoveries of unusually high N/O ratios
in high-redshift galaxies have drawn attention to
Wolf–Rayet (WR) stars as a possible driver of early
Email: tsujita@ioa.s.u-tokyo.ac.jpchemical enrichment (e.g., A. J. Bunker et al. 2023;
Y. Isobe et al. 2023; C. Kobayashi & A. Ferrara 2024;
D. A. Berg et al. 2025). Another element for which
WR stars have been suggested to contribute to its pro-
duction is fluorine (M. Franco et al. 2021). Fluorine
(19F) is one of the few elements whose nucleosynthetic
origin and evolution are still much debated. Its un-arXiv:2602.12885v2  [astro-ph.GA]  16 Feb 2026

usually low cosmic abundance compared to neighbor-
ing elements indicates that standard stellar nucleosyn-
thesis largely bypasses fluorine, making it a sensitive
probe of non-standard stellar yields (e.g., N. Ryde et al.
2020). Theoretically, three astrophysical objects have
been considered as the primary sources of19F produc-
tion: asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, WR stars,
and core-collapse supernovae (SNe II) with the neutrino
process. Among them, AGB stars are the only obser-
vationally confirmed producers (e.g., A. Jorissen et al.
1992; K. Werner et al. 2005; M. Otsuka et al. 2008; S.
Lucatello et al. 2011; C. Abia et al. 2010, 2015), and
low-mass AGB stars (∼2–4M ⊙) are considered the
main contributors to19F production at solar metallic-
ity (e.g., M. Lugaro et al. 2004; A. I. Karakas 2010;
C. Kobayashi et al. 2011b; K. A. Womack et al. 2023).
However, AGB yields alone cannot reproduce the ob-
served fluorine abundances in the solar neighborhood,
implying additional contributions from massive stars
such as WR stars and SNe II (e.g., A. Renda et al.
2004; C. Kobayashi et al. 2011a, 2020; H. J¨ onsson et al.
2014; E. Spitoni et al. 2018; N. Prantzos et al. 2018; N.
Ryde et al. 2020). Although non-AGB contributions are
expected, direct tests are scarce mainly because fluo-
rine tracers are limited to the vibrational–rotational HF
lines in the infrared and the rotational transitions in the
millimeter regime, the latter being inaccessible to local
stars. The vibrational-rotational HF lines are difficult
to detect in extremely metal-poor stars, limiting stel-
lar fluorine measurements to a small number of carbon-
enhanced objects (e.g., A. Mura-Guzm´ an et al. 2020).
This is primarily because most metal-poor stars have
sufficiently high effective temperatures to dissociate HF
molecules. Moreover, such observations probe the pho-
tospheric19F abundance of individual stars rather than
the element already ejected into the interstellar medium
(ISM), leaving the efficiency of19F ejection uncertain.
A complementary approach is to probe fluorine in the
ISM of young but already metal-rich galaxies, where
AGB enrichment is still limited but short-lived massive
stars can operate efficiently. Recently, M. Franco et al.
(2021) serendipitously detected the HF(1–0) absorption
line in a lensed dusty star-forming galaxy (DSFG) at
z= 4.4, about 1.4 Gyr after the Big Bang, when the
contribution from low-mass AGB stars is expected to be
small. Their chemical evolution models showed that this
could be explained either by including yields from WR
stars or by assuming a short starburst timescale (τ SF∼
0.1 Gyr) even without WR contributions. However, the
lack of constraints on the galaxy’s star-formation history
and metallicity left this degeneracy unresolved. To take
the next step, ideal targets for HF absorption are brightDSFGs at high redshift with metallicity measurements.
WhileJames Webb Space Telescope (JWST)has sig-
nificantly improved constraints on the mass–metallicity
relation (MZR) up toz∼10, especially for low- to
intermediate-mass galaxies (e.g., K. Nakajima et al.
2023; R. L. Sanders et al. 2024; A. Sarkar et al. 2025),
the relation remains poorly constrained at the high-mass
end (M⋆≳1010M⊙), although recent work has begun
to explore this regime (e.g., A. L. Faisst et al. 2025). In
addition, estimating stellar masses of DSFGs is difficult
due to severe dust attenuation, requiring deepJWST
observations. Owing to this combination, high-redshift
massive DSFGs with well-determined metallicities re-
main rare.
Among the few most-distant, bright DSFGs known
atz >6, G09.83808 atz= 6.024, corresponding to
a cosmic age of only∼0.9 Gyr after the Big Bang,
(J. A. Zavala et al. 2018; A. Tsujita et al. 2022) pro-
vides the best opportunity to extend such studies. This
DSFG has gas-phase metallicity already enriched toZ≈
0.5–0.7Z⊙, as inferred from the [Nii] 205µm /[Oiii] 88µm
luminosity ratio combined with far-infrared continuum
flux density ratio (K. Tadaki et al. 2022). In addition,
this DSFG benefits from strong lensing (µ∼8−9; K.
Tadaki et al. 2022) and lies on the massive end of the
star-forming main sequence (J. A. Zavala et al. 2022),
offering a more representative view of typicalz∼6 mas-
sive galaxies compared to the other two known extreme
DSFGs atz >6, which are intrinsically much brighter
(S870µm,intr>10 mJy) and reside in proto-cluster en-
vironments (D. A. Riechers et al. 2013; D. P. Marrone
et al. 2018). In this Letter, we present ALMA HF(1–0)
absorption line observations toward G09.83808, aiming
to investigate early fluorine production.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 de-
scribes the observations and data reduction. Section
3 presents the HF absorption analysis and the derived
fluorine abundance constraint. In Section 4, we compare
our observational constraints with a chemical evolution
model. Throughout the paper, we adopt a cosmology
with Ω m= 0.3, Ω Λ= 0.7, andH 0= 70 km s−1Mpc−1
and the Kroupa initial mass function (P. Kroupa 2001).
2.OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION
Our ALMA Band 5 observations of G09.83808 were
conducted between October and December 2024 during
Cycle 10–11 (Project code: 2023.1.01281.S; PI: A. Tsu-
jita). We targeted the HF(1–0) absorption line (ν rest=
1232.48 GHz;ν obs= 175.47 GHz atz= 6.024), covering
∼161.7–175.8 GHz in the 4-bit mode. The observations
were carried out in multiple scheduling blocks using the
C43-3/4/5 antenna configurations. All datasets were
3
calibrated using the standard ALMA pipeline inCASA
package ( CASA Team et al. 2022). Continuum sub-
traction was performed with theuvcontsubtask, care-
fully selecting line-free channels for each tuning. We
first created a clean mask from the continuum map im-
aged with Briggs weighting (robust parameter of 0.0),
using theauto-multithreshalgorithm (A. A. Kepley
et al. 2020). This clean mask was then reused for all
line cubes (white contours in Figure 1). Line imag-
ing was carried out using thetcleantask with natu-
ral weighting, adopting a cell size of 0.15′′and clean-
ing down tonsigma=2. The final spectral cube has
a synthesized beam of 1.2′′×0.96′′and an rms noise
of 0.08 mJy beam−1per 50 km s−1channel at the fre-
quency of the HF(1–0) line. Velocity-integrated maps
were created by integrating over±300 km s−1around
the expected line center.
Figure 1 shows the dust continuum map and the
continuum-subtracted velocity-integrated maps of the
HF(1–0), CO(10–9), and H 2O(220–211) lines. Given the
modest angular resolution, the lensed image is resolved
into two arcs in the continuum map. We extract a single-
beam spectrum at the peak pixel of each arc in the con-
tinuum image (red cross marks in Figure 1) and sum
them channel by channel to form the total spectrum.
For each channel, the 1σuncertainty is estimated from
the rms measured in blank regions outside the source.
Figure 2 presents the continuum-subtracted spectrum
centered on the systemic velocity, binned to 50 km s−1.
For comparison, we overlay the HF(1–0) absorption line
with the CO(10–9) (blended with H 2O(312–221)) and
the H 2O(220–211) lines from the same dataset.
3.RESULTS
We calculate the fluorine abundance from the obtained
spectrum. As shown in Figure 2, a tentative HF(1–
0) absorption feature is seen near the systemic veloc-
ity, with a peak depth of−0.30±0.08 mJy (3.8σ) at
−50 km s−1. We define the integration range using the
unblended H 2O(211–202) line, selecting channels with>
1σsignal, which yields [−300,+300] km s−1. Within this
range, the HF(1–0) velocity-integrated flux is−43±20
mJy km s−1(2.2σ). Given the modest signal-to-noise
ratio, we conservatively treat this measurement as an
upper limit in the analysis below. For reference, we also
calculate the integrated flux over [−450,0] km s−1where
the HF signal itself exceeds 1σ, which yields−97±17
mJy km s−1(5.7σ). However, using either this value or
the 5σupper limit adopted below does not affect our
main conclusions. The continuum level, measured at
the same two pixels and summed in the same way, is
4.24±0.02 mJy.Because the HFJ= 1 level has an extremely high
critical density ofn crit∼1010cm−3atT= 50 K (D. A.
Neufeld et al. 2005), essentially all HF resides in the
ground state and theJ= 1–0 absorption traces the to-
tal HF column density. The HF column density can
therefore be obtained from the velocity–integrated opti-
cal depth using the relation given by D. A. Neufeld et al.
(2010):
/integraldisplay
τ(v)dv= 4.16×10−13NHF cm2km s−1
Applying this relation to the 5σflux limit yieldsN HF<
6.0×1014cm−2(5σ). However, we note that this upper
limit may still underestimate the true HF abundance,
because (1) the continuum emission may not fully illu-
minate all absorbing clouds along the line of sight, (2)
only gas in front of the continuum source contributes to
the absorption, and (3) any HF in excited states is not
accounted for.
Next, we constrain the HF abundance ratio by esti-
mating the molecular hydrogen column density as fol-
lows. Using the intrinsic molecular gas mass (2.0±
0.7)×1010M⊙from CO(2–1) line (J. A. Zavala et al.
2022), together with a CO-to-H 2conversion factor of
αCO= 1.0M⊙(K km s−1pc2)−1, CO excitation ratio of
r21= 0.83±0.10 (M. S. Bothwell et al. 2013), and as-
suming the gas follows the [Cii] 158µm distribution with
a half-light radius of∼1 kpc (A. Tsujita et al. in prepa-
ration), we obtainN H2= 2.7×1023cm−2. The corre-
sponding abundance limit isN HF/NH2<2.2×10−9or
log10(NHF/NH2)<−8.7 (5σ). We adopt aα COvalue
commonly used for local ULIRGs (e.g., D. Downes &
P. M. Solomon 1998). For G09.83808, dynamical con-
straints suggestα CO<2.5M⊙(K km s−1pc2)−1(J. A.
Zavala et al. 2022). Adopting a largerα COwould in-
creaseN H2and thus decreaseN HF/NH2, so our qualita-
tive conclusions below remain unchanged.
Because HF forms efficiently via the exothermic reac-
tion F + H 2→HF + H and is resistant to destruction
under typical interstellar conditions, it is expected to be
the dominant gas–phase reservoir of fluorine wherever
hydrogen is predominantly molecular (e.g., C. Zhu et al.
2002). Consequently, the abundance ratioN HF/NH2
provides a sensitive empirical indicator of fluorine en-
richment. Figure 3 places our constraint in this context
by comparing it with HF detections and limits in the
Milky Way, nearby galaxies, and high–redshift galax-
ies/quasars. In the solar neighborhood, the fluorine
abundance is A(F) = 12+log(F/H) = 4.40, correspond-
ing to F/H = 2.5×10−8(number ratio, E. Maiorca et al.

NHF/NH2if nearly all fluorine is locked in HF. Observa-
tions of diffuse molecular clouds in the Milky Way yield
slightly lower ratios,N HF/NH2∼(1−2)×10−8(e.g., P.
Sonnentrucker et al. 2010). At low molecular columns
(NH2≲1022.5cm−2), these measurements follow a rela-
tively tight correlation betweenN HFandN H2. At higher
NH2and toward higher redshift (R. R. Monje et al.
2011a; M. D. Lehnert et al. 2020; M. Franco et al. 2021),
the relation becomes less clear, showing larger scatter
and a possible flattening aroundN HF∼1015cm−2. Our
5σupper limit for G09.83808 also lies below these ref-
erence values, extending fluorine abundance constraints
toz= 6.

tial of the vibrational–rotational HF line reported A(F) = 4.56,
corresponding to F/H = 3.6×10−8(M. Asplund et al. 2009).

leaf atz= 2.56 (R. R. Monje et al. 2011a).
4.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
To interpret our HF constraint, we compare it with the
galactic chemical evolution model of C. Kobayashi et al.
5
(2020), which is also adopted by M. Franco et al. (2021).
This model self-consistently includes fluorine production
from all plausible sources, namely AGB stars (including
super-AGB stars), core-collapse supernovae (including
hypernovae), and rotationally enhanced WR winds; the
neutrino process in C. Kobayashi et al. (2011a) is un-
certain and isnotincluded. Therefore, fluorine is en-
hanced in AGB and WR stars by He-burning. The in-
clusion of the rotating massive stars is a key feature, as
stellar rotation enhances internal mixing and mass loss,
enabling the ejection of fluorine even at lower stellar
masses (≳20M ⊙) and metallicities.
The yields are taken from M. Limongi & A. Chieffi
(2018), adopting a rotation velocity ofv rot= 300 km s−1
for all stars with initial masses of 13–120M ⊙; this rep-
resents a maximum WR contribution, since such a high
rotation speed is applied uniformly across all massive
stars regardless of metallicity. The fiducial model adopts
a Kroupa IMF (a slope ofx= 1.3 for 0.01–120M ⊙);
a more bottom-heavy IMF would increase the relative
contribution from AGB stars but suppress that from
massive stars, leading to lower total fluorine yields (for
a given star formation history (SFH)). In galactic chem-
ical evolution models, the metallicity in the ISM is cal-
culated as a function of time, assuming the formation
epoch, the star-formation timescaleτ SF, and the gas-
infall timescaleτ in. These model parameters are de-
generate and should be constrained from observations,
which we do in this paper. For G09.83808, we have
two independent observational constraints, namely the
gas-phase metallicity (Z≈0.5–0.7Z ⊙; K. Tadaki et al.
2022) and the molecular gas fraction (f gas≃0.20; J. A.
Zavala et al. 2022). Once the observed gas fraction is
imposed, the formation epoch is effectively fixed; in the
fiducial solution it corresponds toz form∼8.5. Adopting
τin= 1 Gyr, the observed metallicity is then reproduced
with a star-formation timescale ofτ SF= 0.37 Gyr. We
refer to this combination as our fiducial model. These
constraints represent a major improvement over the pre-
vious study by M. Franco et al. (2021), for which the
star-formation history remained largely uncertain. We
note that in this fiducial model, the newly produced F
from AGB stars is only 0.23% of the total fluorine abun-
dance atz= 6.02, indicating that the contribution from
AGB stars is negligible at this epoch.
Figure 4 (top panel) compares our observational con-
straint with the fiducial model predictions. The left
panel shows the evolution of oxygen abundance A(O),
which serves as a proxy for overall metallicity and is
used to anchor each model track to the observed value
for G09.83808. The right panel shows the corresponding
fluorine abundance A(F). Our 5σupper limit on HF/H 2(<2.2×10−9) is consistent with the models without
WR yields and does not require additional fluorine pro-
duction from massive stars.
To assess the robustness of this result, we explore vari-
ations in the model parameters, as illustrated in the
Figure 4. First of all, reducing the rotation velocity of
massive stars from 300 to 150 km s−1produces negligible
changes in both the oxygen and fluorine evolution tracks
(top panel). Secondly, We examine models with differ-
ent star-formation and infall timescales (middle panel).
When the observed metallicity and gas fraction are im-
posed, changingτ SFsimply requires a compensating
change inτ in, and all such combinations converge to
the same fluorine abundance. Thus the predicted A(F)
is insensitive to variations in the SFH under these con-
straints. Finally, we vary the IMF slope (bottom panel).
Changing the Kroupa IMF slope fromx= 1.3 to either
x= 1.1 (top–heavy) orx= 1.7 (bottom–heavy) yields
modest differences in fluorine abundance (∼0.1–0.4 dex),
but the resulting oxygen abundance A(O) fails to match
the observed metallicity. After adjustingτ SFto repro-
duceZ≈0.5–0.7Z ⊙, the predicted A(F) converges back
to the fiducial track. Taken together, these tests demon-
strate that the low HF abundance in G09.83808 cannot
be explained with WR stars, even varying stellar rota-
tion velocity, SFH, or IMF slope. With both the metal-
licity and gas fraction independently known, the fluorine
abundance becomes a direct probe of the underlying nu-
cleosynthesis, allowing us to place strong constraints on
the contribution of WR stars atz>6.
We discuss possible explanations for the low HF abun-
dance observed in G09.83808. First, partial depletion of
HF onto dust grains could in principle lower the ob-
served HF column density, particularly in dense, cold
environments where freeze-out becomes efficient (e.g.,
M. H. D. van der Wiel et al. 2016). However, the rel-
atively high dust temperature (T dust = 51±4 K; K.
Tadaki et al. 2022) and the elevated cosmic microwave
background temperature atz= 6 (T CMB = 19.2 K)
render freeze-out inefficient under typical ISM densities
(nH∼103–104cm−3). Following the arguments of M.
Franco et al. (2021), such high dust and radiation tem-
peratures significantly shorten the thermal desorption
timescale relative to the freeze-out timescale, making it
unlikely that a significant fraction of HF is locked onto
dust grains.
Second, the galaxy may be observed during a partic-
ular phase in an intermittent SFH, a scenario proposed
to explain elevated N/O ratios in high-redshift galaxies
(e.g., C. Kobayashi & A. Ferrara 2024). In this frame-
work, after the initial starburst, secondary gas inflow di-
lutes the ISM and triggers a secondary star burst, from
6
which WR stars cause high (N, F)/O. Then, SNe II dom-
inate to decrease (N, F)/(O, Fe) ratios until the onset of
AGB enrichment. In fact, Figure 4 of C. Kobayashi & A.
Ferrara (2024) shows that [F/Fe] declines sharply dur-
ing this post-burst phase. If G09.83808 is in the SNe II
enrichment phase, its high metallicity and low fluorine
abundance would be naturally explained.
Third, the WR fluorine yields themselves remain
highly uncertain, depending on model assumptions such
as mass-loss rates, convection, magnetic field, and the
way to include rotation (e.g., M. Limongi & A. Chieffi
2018).
By contrast, thez= 4.4 galaxy studied by M. Franco
et al. (2021) exhibits a much higher HF abundance.
Within the similar chemical–evolution framework, such
a value can be reproduced either by including rotation-
enhanced WR yields or by adopting a very short star-
formation timescale (τ SF∼0.1 Gyr). However, due
to the lack of independent constraints on the galaxy’s
metallicity or SFH, the model remained degenerate in
that case. Our result for G09.83808 breaks this degen-
eracy and reveals that WR-driven fluorine production
was not yet efficient for this case. The discrepancy be-
tween these two galaxies may reflect diversity in star-
formation modes, enrichment histories, or WR activ-
ity among early galaxies. Expanding the sample of HF
absorption measurements in high-redshift galaxies with
known metallicities will be crucial to trace the onset
and evolution of fluorine production from massive stars
across cosmic time.

Figure 4.Predicted evolution of the oxygen abundance A(O) (left) and fluorine abundance A(F) (right) for chemical–evolution
models constrained to reproduce the observed metallicity of G09.83808 (Z≈0.5–0.7Z ⊙; K. Tadaki et al. 2022), shown as the
gray band in the A(O) panel and its gas fraction (f gas= 0.2; J. A. Zavala et al. 2022). (Top) Fiducial models, all of which
assume a Kroupa IMF with slopex= 1.3. WR–included cases adopt a stellar rotation velocity ofv rot= 300 km s−1except
for the thin line. Blue and orange curves denote models with and without WR yields, respectively. The solid curves show the
model withτ SF= 0.37 Gyr andτ in= 1 Gyr, while the dashed curves adoptτ SF= 0.3 Gyr. A slower–rotation WR model
(vrot= 150 km s−1, blue thin curve) is shown for comparison and differs only slightly from the 300 km s−1WR model. The
vertical dotted line marksz= 6.024. In the A(F) panel, the gray horizontal line shows the solar abundance (E. Maiorca et al.
2014), and the red star marks our 5σupper limit. This limit is consistent with models without WR enrichment and with
longer star-formation timescales. (Middle) Models with different star-formation and infall timescales. The bold curves show
an alternative SFH (τ SF= 0.18 Gyr,τ in= 0.5 Gyr) that also satisfies the observed metallicity and gas–fraction constraints,
while the faint curves are the fiducial models. To satisfy the constraints, the models yield nearly identical A(F) regardless of
the adopted timescales. (Bottom) Models exploring variations in the IMF slope. The dotted lines adopt IMF slopes ofx= 1.1
(red) andx= 1.7 (blue) while keeping all other parameters at the fiducial values; these models fail to reproduce the observed
metallicity. The solid red and blue curves retune the star–formation timescale toτ SF= 0.45 and 0.32 Gyr, respectively, so that
the models match the observed metallicity, in which case the predicted A(F) remains similar to the fiducial case.
