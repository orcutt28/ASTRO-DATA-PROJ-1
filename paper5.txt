ABSTRACT
The recent discovery of three off-nuclear tidal disruption events (EP240222a, AT2024tvd, and
AT2025abcr)—following the first such source, 3XMM J2150−05—reveals a small but robust popula-
tion of off-nuclear, or “wandering,” black holes (WBHs) with massesM •>104M⊙. Two demographic
trends are already apparent: (i) all events occur in massive, early-type parent galaxies with stellar
masses 10.8≲log10(M⋆/M⊙)≲11.1; and (ii) events at larger halo-centric radii (R TDE/R200) are
associated with dwarf satellites (M ⋆∼107M⊙), while those closer to halo centers lack detected stellar
counterparts. Using results from theROMULUScosmological simulation, we show that both trends natu-
rally arise from hierarchical galaxy formation. By combining the simulation with empirical constraints
on the local galaxy population, we compute the volumetric density of WBHs,ϕ WBH(M⋆), finding that
it peaks at log10(M⋆/M⊙) = 11.10+0.05
−0.10 and that more than half of all WBHs in the local Universe
reside in galaxies with 10.7≲log10(M⋆/M⊙)≲11.2, explaining (i) and predicting its persistence
as the sample grows. We further show that ii), i.e., the observed link between detection of stellar
counterparts andR TDE/R200, is also expected from tidal stripping. These results demonstrate that
off-nuclear TDEs are powered by the population of WBHs long predicted by cosmological simulations.

1.INTRODUCTION
It is now established that nearly all massive galaxies
host a massive black hole (MBH) at their centers (Ko-
rmendy & Ho 2013). MBH masses correlate strongly
with the properties of their host galaxies’ central re-
gions (Magorrian et al. 1998; Ferrarese & Merritt 2000;
Tremaine et al. 2002; G¨ ultekin et al. 2009), indicating
a co-evolution of black holes and galaxies over cosmic
time (e.g., Volonteri et al. 2003; Natarajan 2014).
In the standard paradigm of galaxy formation, MBHs
grow primarily through gas accretion in galactic nuclei,
producing active galactic nuclei (AGN), while galaxies
assemble hierarchically through mergers. This process
naturally leads to a population of MBHs1that are dis-
placed from galaxy centers in the local Universe.
The pathway from galactic scales to the coalescence of
MBH binaries in galactic centers involve multiple phys-
ical processes operating across wide spatial and tem-
1Here MBHs are defined as black holes not formed through stan-
dard stellar evolution, i.e., with massesM •≫103M⊙, including
intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs; 103≪M •≲105M⊙)
and supermassive black holes (SMBHs;M •≫105M⊙).poral scales (Begelman et al. 1980; Colpi 2014). Only
MBHs that efficiently sink to galactic centers can form
bound binaries and eventually merge, producing grav-
itational waves detectable by space-based interferom-
eters such as LISA (Amaro-Seoane et al. 2017). In
many systems, however, orbital decay stalls at kilopar-
sec scales, where dynamical friction dominates (Chan-
drasekhar 1943) and can exceed a Hubble time for suffi-
ciently low-mass MBHs. As a result, a substantial pop-
ulation of off-nuclear MBHs is expected to persist to low
redshift.
The existence of these long-lived, off-nuclear massive
black holes was predicted based on semi-analytical cal-
culations, well before modern hydrodynamical simula-
tions, as a natural consequence of hierarchical galaxy
assembly and inefficient orbital decay (e.g., Governato
et al. 1994; Volonteri et al. 2003; Islam et al. 2004;
Bellovary et al. 2010).
Nowadays cosmological simulations are the primary
theoretical tool for studying this population of wander-
ing black holes (WBHs), here defined as MBHs not lo-
cated at the center of their main galactic halo or residing
in satellite substructures. In particular, those simula-
tions that seed black holes based on local gas properties,arXiv:2602.12970v1  [astro-ph.GA]  13 Feb 2026

Figure 1.Pre-TDE optical imaging of the parent galaxies of the four known off-nuclear tidal disruption events. For each
source, the panel shows a color composite of the host galaxy and a zoomed-in view centered on the TDE location. Purple circles
mark the most precise positions of the transients, derived from space-based X-ray or ultraviolet observations. Pronounced
stellar overdensities consistent with bound dwarf satellites are detected for 3XMM J2150−05 and EP240222a, whereas no
resolved stellar counterpart is visible at the locations of AT2024tvd and AT2025abcr above the smooth halo light. The stellar
counterpart overdensities (or lack thereof) are quantified in Appendix C, and the results are shown in Table 1.
incorporate subgrid prescriptions for dynamical friction,
and allow MBHs to orbit freely rather than being arti-
ficially repositioned at halo centers. Notable examples
includeROMULUS(Tremmel et al. 2017) andASTRID(Ni
et al. 2022) simulations.
Studies based onROMULUSfind a roughly linear scal-
ing between the number of WBHs per halo and the halo
virial mass, with Milky Way–like halos hosting order ten
WBHs (Tremmel et al. 2018a) and massive galaxy clus-
ters hosting more than a thousand (Ricarte et al. 2021b).
Despite their predicted abundance, WBHs are expected
to accrete weakly in the local Universe, with typical Ed-
dington ratios≲10−4(Ricarte et al. 2021a), owing to
gas-poor environments and the lack of efficient angular-momentum diffusion mechanisms, such as those avail-
able to secularly fed central SMBHs (Storchi-Bergmann
& Schnorr-M¨ uller 2019). This makes them extremely
difficult to detect directly, and observationally WBHs
have therefore proven elusive.
Non-accreting WBHs have been inferred dynamically
in a small number of ultra-compact dwarf galaxies
(UCDs; e.g., Seth et al. 2014; Taylor et al. 2025), which
are common in galaxy clusters (Pfeffer et al. 2014;
Voggel et al. 2019). Accreting WBHs have been pro-
posed to appear as off-nuclear AGN, particularly in
merging systems (Comerford et al. 2009; Comerford &
Greene 2014; Reines et al. 2020; Ward et al. 2021; Up-
pal et al. 2024), but such sources are rare and often
3
ambiguous (e.g., Sturm et al. 2026), being difficult to
distinguish from recoiling SMBHs or from dual, similar-
mass AGN produced by major mergers. WBHs (of
intermediate mass) have also been invoked as engines
of some ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs;L X≳
1039erg s−1), although most objects in this class are now
understood to be extreme stellar-mass accretors (Kaaret
et al. 2017). A notable exception is ESO 243–49 HLX-
1 (Farrell et al. 2009; Soria et al. 2017), which reaches
LX∼1042erg s−1and provided the first strong case for
an accreting off-nuclear IMBH; however, this source ap-
pears unique, and the physical origin of its repeating
outbursts remains unclear.
If the WBHs retain some bound stellar population,
tidal disruption events (TDEs, Rees 1988; Gezari et al.
2021) can supply the accreting material needed to briefly
power luminous emission. Such off-nuclear TDEs there-
fore provide one of the most direct and unambiguous
probes of WBHs. Unlike AGN, black hole masses in
TDEs can be inferred directly from multi-wavelength
modeling based on first principle models, independent
of any scaling relations (like those based on single-epoch
broad line emission measurements, which are poorly cal-
ibrated at the low mass end of interest here) enabling,
e.g., black hole–host scaling relations to be recover in-
dependently (e.g., Mummery et al. 2024; Guolo et al.
2025).
The discovery of 3XMM J215-05 in 2018 (Lin et al.
2018, 2020) marked the first off-nuclear TDE. Over the
past year, three additional sources have been identi-
fied: EP240222a (Jin et al. 2025) byEinstein Probe
(Yuan et al. 2018), and AT2024tvd (Yao et al. 2025) and
AT2025abcr (Stein et al. 2026) by the Zwicky Transient
Facility (Bellm et al. 2019).
Despite the small current sample, two demographic
trends are already apparent. All events occur in mas-
sive, early-type parent galaxies with total stellar masses
in the order ofM ⋆∼1011M⊙. In addition, the two
events at larger halo-centric radii (R TDE/R200) are as-
sociated with dwarf satellite galaxies (M ⋆∼107M⊙),
while those occurring closer to halo centers lack de-
tectable stellar counterparts. The goal of thisLetteris
to show that these trends arise naturally from hierarchi-
cal galaxy and black hole assembly and can be extracted
from theROMULUSsimulation results. In§2 we describe
the off-nuclear TDE sample and simulation data; in§3
we present our results; and we conclude in§4. In this pa-
per we adopt a flatλCDM cosmology, withH 0= 69 km
s−1Mpc−1(Planck Collaboration et al. 2020); uncer-tainties (error-bars and contours) are reported as 68%
credible intervals, unless otherwise stated.
2.OFF-NUCLEAR TDES AND THEROMULUS
SIMULATIONS
2.1.Sample and Properties
Our sample consists of four sources: 3XMM J215-
05, EP20240222a, AT2024tvd, and AT2025abcr. These
sources share several defining properties: (i) transient
multi-wavelength light curves; (ii) detections spanning
X-ray through UV/optical wavelengths; (iii) super-
soft/thermal X-ray spectra, a unique feature of TDEs
(Guolo et al. 2024); (iv) peak X-ray luminositiesL X>
1042erg s−1(excluding stellar-mass accretors); and (v)
when early-time optical spectra are available (all except
3XMM J215-05), the presence of transient broad Balmer
emission lines and, in some cases, higher-ionization fea-
tures such as He II and Bowen fluorescence, similar
to those observed in nuclear TDEs (Charalampopou-
los et al. 2022). Crucially, however, all four sources
are significantly displaced from the centers of their par-
ent galaxies, with projected offsets ranging from 0.9′′
to 53′′. These properties are individually all character-
istic of TDEs (e.g., van Velzen et al. 2021; Charalam-
popoulos et al. 2022; Yao et al. 2023; Guolo et al. 2024;
Mummery et al. 2024; Grotova et al. 2025; Mummery &
van Velzen 2025) and, when considered together, make
these events the most secure cases of off-nuclear TDEs
currently known.
Two additional sources, eRASS J1421−29 (Grotova
et al. 2025) and 4XMM J1615+19 (also known as
NGC 6099 HLX-1; Chang et al. 2025), are, in our view,
likely to be genuine off-nuclear TDEs. However, the
analyses presented for these sources and/or the currently
available data are, in our view, yet insufficient to con-
clusively rule out alternative explanations. We therefore
do not include them in our sample2.
A third source, WINGS J1348+26 (Maksym et al.
2013; Donato et al. 2014), is a TDE originating from the
nucleus of a dwarf galaxy (M ⋆∼108M⊙), spectroscopi-
cally confirmed to be associated with the galaxy cluster
Abell 1795 (Maksym et al. 2014). In some sense, this
event could be considered “off-nuclear” with respect to
the cluster center (and its brightest cluster galaxy, BCG)
and would qualify as such under the definition of wan-
dering black holes inROMULUS. At this point, however,
this classification becomes largely a matter of semantics
2Importantly, both sources seems to be associated with massive
early-type galaxies with stellar masses similar to those of our
hosts. Including them would not alter our conclusions regarding
the galaxy-mass preference discussed in§3.1.

and arbitrary definitions, and we choose not to include
this source in our sample.
We also do not include luminous fast blue optical tran-
sients (LFBOTs; e.g., Perley et al. 2019; Ho et al. 2023;
Somalwar et al. 2025) or ESO 243–49 HLX-1. Although
these sources have been interpreted as TDEs by some
authors, their observed properties—including light-
curve evolution, repeating of outbursts, and/or spectral
characteristics—are fundamentally distinct from those
of the off-nuclear TDEs analyzed here, suggesting a dif-
ferent physical origin.
Having selected and described our sample, Fig. 1
shows pre-TDE color images of the four parent galaxies,
with zoomed-in regions indicating the TDE locations.
Images are taken from the Legacy Survey (Dey et al.
2019) for all sources except 3XMM J215-05, for which
deeper pre-TDE CFHT MegaCam (Gwyn 2012) data are
available. The purple circles mark the most precise tran-
sient positions, derived from space-based UV or X-ray
observations using eitherChandra(∼1′′PSF) orHST
(∼0.1′′PSF). Clear stellar overdensities are visible at
the locations of 3XMM J215-05 and EP20240222a, but
not for AT2024tvd or AT2025abcr. The latter is con-
firmed by detailed image decomposition analyses pre-
sented by Yao et al. (2025) and Stein et al. (2026).
In Table 1, we summarize the basic parent-galaxy
properties: redshift (z); projected (R TDE,p ) and depro-
jected (R TDE) offsets of the TDEs from their host nuclei;
stellar (M ⋆) and virial (M 200) masses; half-light (R 1/2)
and virial (R 200) radii; and the ratio of local to halo stel-
lar surface densities (Σ ⋆,local /Σ⋆,halo ). Projected offsets
are taken from the discovery papers, while deprojected
distances assume an isotropic orientation distribution,
i.e.,R TDE=RTDE,p
sin(θ), withP(θ)∝cosθ. Half-light radii
are taken from the Legacy Survey Data Release 10 (Dey
et al. 2019), and virial masses and radii are inferred from
M⋆andR 1/2as described in Appendix A.
Rather than relying on heterogeneous (distinct stel-
lar population models and/or apertures) stellar-mass es-
timates from the literature, we measure parent-galaxy
stellar masses in a uniform manner. As described inAppendix B, we adopt a color-dependent mass-to-light
ratio (M ⋆/Li) applied to S´ ersic-profile luminosities, fol-
lowing the same approach used by Baldry et al. (2012)
to derive the local galaxy stellar mass function. This
choice is essential for our comparison with GSMF pre-
dictions in§3. Our derived stellar masses are consistent
with those reported in the discovery papers, typically
within∼0.1 dex, but at most∼0.2 dex, which does not
affect our conclusions. Finally, the local-to-halo stellar
overdensities for 3XMM J215-05 and EP20240222a are
calculated using the deepest available pre-TDE imag-
ing—HSTand the Legacy Survey, respectively—as de-
scribed in Appendix C.
We do not present black hole mass estimates for the
full sample. A reliable and uniform method capable of
recovering black hole–host scaling relations has not yet
been applied to all four sources. The method of Guolo
& Mummery (2025) has been applied to AT2024tvd
and 3XMM J215-05 Guolo et al. (2025, 2026), find-
ing that the black hole powering AT2024tvd is approx-
imately∼106/104.4≃40 times more massive than
that of 3XMM J215-05. Comparable estimates are un-
available for the remaining events, precluding a homo-
geneous comparison. Moreover, in theROMULUSsimu-
lations all black holes are seeded with the same initial
mass,M •= 106M⊙, preventing a direct comparison
between simulated and observed black hole masses.
2.2.ROMULUSSimulation
We summarize here the aspects of massive black hole
(MBH) modeling in theROMULUSsimulations most rel-
evant to this work; full technical details are provided
in Tremmel et al. (2017, 2019); Ricarte et al. (2021b).
The simulation suite consists ofROMULUS25, a (25 Mpc)3
cosmological volume, andROMULUSC, a higher-resolution
zoom-in simulation of a galaxy cluster withM 200∼
1014M⊙. Both were run using the Tree+SPH code
ChaNGa(Menon et al. 2015; Wadsley et al. 2017), with
dark matter and gas particle masses of 3.4×105M⊙and
2.1×105M⊙, respectively.

The simulations include a correction for unresolved
gravitational forces below scales of 350 pc (the so-called
softening length), which would otherwise underestimate
the dynamical friction acting on moving MBHs. This
correction follows the classical formulation of Chan-
drasekhar (1943), allowing MBHs to orbit freely within
their host halos rather than being artificially pinned to
galaxy centers (Tremmel et al. 2015). MBH mergers
are permitted once pairs become gravitationally bound
within two softening lengths, corresponding to∼0.7
kpc. This work directly adopts theROMULUSpost-
processing analysis presented in Ricarte et al. (2021b).
In that study, halos were identified using theAmiga
halo finder (Knollmann & Knebe 2009), which was used
to measure halo masses, radii, and centers. MBHs were
assigned to halos or substructures based on gravitational
binding, and halo centers were determined with an ac-
curacy limited by the gravitational softening length of
350 pc.
In Ricarte et al. (2021b), MBHs were classified as
“central” if located within 0.7 kpc of the halo center
and as “wandering” otherwise. This definition allows for
multiple central MBHs within a single halo and permits
even the most massive or luminous MBH to be classi-
fied as wandering. The adopted threshold reflects un-
certainties in MBH dynamics and center determination
and corresponds to the scale below which MBH mergers
are allowed. Beyond this radius, MBH orbits are well
resolved and not artificially close to merging.
Here we explicitly use three results describing the low-
redshift (z∼0.05) wandering black hole population re-
ported by Ricarte et al. (2021b). These results are dis-cussed in detail in the next section, but are summarized
here for convenience:
•The mean number of wandering black holes per
halo increases approximately linearly with halo
virial mass, reflecting the cumulative impact of hi-
erarchical mergers and satellite accretion. This is
shown in the left panel of Fig. 2.
•Byz∼0, most wandering black holes no longer
retain a resolved stellar counterpart as a result
of tidal stripping; those that do are preferentially
found at larger halo-centric distances.
•Wandering black holes populate a broad range
of halo-centric distances, with a characteris-
tic concentration at intermediate radii (0.01≲
R•/R200≲0.1), and an extended distribution
reaching from the halo nucleus to near the virial
radius.
3.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1.Parent Galaxy Preference
From Table 1 it is immediately apparent, as first noted
by Yao et al. (2025), that the parent galaxies of off-
nuclear TDEs share remarkably similar global proper-
ties. All four events occur in massive, early-type galax-
ies, with total stellar masses confined to the narrow
range 10.8≲log10(M⋆/M⊙)≲11.1. Given the small
current sample, this uniformity is striking and suggests
an underlying physical or demographic origin rather
than a coincidence.
This combination of high stellar mass and early-type
morphology is notablynotcharacteristic of the hosts of

nuclear TDEs (Hammerstein et al. 2021; Yao et al. 2023;
Mummery & van Velzen 2025). Early-type galaxies in
this mass regime typically have central stellar velocity
dispersionsσ ⋆≳200 km s−1, implying central black
hole massesM •≳108.5M⊙based on theM •–σ⋆relation
(Kormendy & Ho 2013). At these masses, the nuclear
TDE rate is super-exponentially suppressed by the Hills
mass effect (Yao et al. 2023; Mummery & van Velzen
2025), since stars are swallowed whole for most combi-
nations of stellar mass and black hole spin. This follows
from the different scaling of the tidal radius (r T∝M1/3
•)
and the event horizon (r H∝M•) with black hole mass.
We now show that the preference for this specific class
of galaxies arises naturally from the demographics of
wandering black holes predicted byROMULUS, once com-
bined with the observed local galaxy population. To
this end, we compute the volumetric density of wander-
ing black holes as a function of parent galaxy stellar
mass,ϕ WBH(M⋆).
As discussed in§2.2 and shown in the left top panel of
Fig. 2, the mean number of WBHs per halo inROMULUS
scales approximately linearly with halo virial mass. The
simulation results are well described by:

+B,(1)withA= 1.17±0.17 andB= 0.95±0.223The quasi-
linear nature of the⟨N WBH⟩–M 200relation is a key in-
gredient of this result. While the absolute normalization
of the relation depends on the specific black hole seeding
prescription adopted inROMULUS, its slope is expected
to be a robust feature of hierarchical structure forma-
tion. In particular, the accumulation of wandering black
holes is driven primarily by the merger and accretion
history of the host halo, rather than by the details of
early black hole formation physics. Alternative seeding
models may therefore shift the overall normalization of
⟨NWBH⟩(e.g., Untzaga et al. 2024), but are not expected
to qualitatively alter the strong, monotonic increase of
WBH abundance with halo mass.
To express this relation in terms of galaxy stellar mass,
we adopt the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) pa-
rameterization of Moster et al. (2013),

ties are based only on the scatter introduced by the somewhat
large bin size.

γ= 0.61±0.06. This mapping is shown in the middle
left panel of Fig. 2.
Finally, to account for the abundance of galaxies as
a function of stellar mass, we adopt the local galaxy
stellar mass function (GSMF) of Baldry et al. (2012),
parameterized as a double Schechter function,
ϕgal(M⋆) dM ⋆= ln(10)e−M⋆/M∗

GSMF is shown in middle right panel of Fig. 2.
The volumetric density of wandering black holes as a
function of parent galaxy stellar mass is then given by
ϕWBH(M⋆)∝ϕ gal(M⋆)⟨N WBH[M200(M⋆)]⟩.(4)
Equation (4) captures the competing effects that
shape the WBH demographics. Low-mass galaxies
(log10(M⋆/M⊙)≲10) dominate the galaxy number
density but host, on average,⟨N WBH⟩≲1 wandering
black hole per system. Conversely, very massive galax-
ies (log10(M⋆/M⊙)≳11.3) host many hundreds to thou-
sands of WBHs each, but are exponentially rare. As a
result, their product peaks at intermediate-to-high stel-
lar masses, where galaxies are both sufficiently common
and individually rich in wandering black holes.
The resultingϕ WBH(M⋆) is shown by the purple
curve in Fig. 3. The distribution peaks sharply at
log10(M⋆/M⊙) = 11.10+0.05
−0.10 (note the log scale). The
cumulative distribution, shown in yellow, indicates that
more than 50% of all wandering black holes in the local
Universe reside in galaxies with 10.7≲log10(M⋆/M⊙)≲
11.2. All currently known off-nuclear TDE parent galax-
ies fall squarely within this dominant interval (Table 1).
The observed preference of off-nuclear TDEs for mas-
sive, early-type galaxies therefore follows naturally from
the demographics of wandering black holes. Even with
the probability for an individual WBH to produce a
TDE been independent of parent galaxy properties, the
observed parent-galaxy distribution will cluster around
M⋆∼1011M⊙, simply because this is where the cos-
mic density of wandering black holes is maximized. In
this sense, the parent-galaxy preference of off-nuclear
TDEs is a purely demographic consequence of hierar-
chical structure formation.
Finally, the early-type morphology of the observed
hosts is also consistent with this picture. In the mass
range 10.7≲log10(M⋆/M⊙)≲11.2, the local galaxy
population is dominated by quenched spheroids, whilestar-forming late-type galaxies are already exponentially
suppressed, as shown in the right panel of Fig. 2, which
show the local GSMF divided in blue (star-forming) and
red (quenched) galaxies. More specifically, in this mass
range, red (quenched) galaxies are∼7times more com-
mon than blue (star-forming) galaxies. The observed
morphological preference therefore also follows from the
same demographic peak inϕ WBH(M⋆).
A clear prediction of this framework is that, as the
sample of off-nuclear TDEs grows, their parent galaxies
will continue to be drawn predominantly from the nar-
row stellar-mass range 10.7≲log10(M⋆/M⊙)≲11.2.
3.2.Stellar Counterparts
In addition to the preference for massive parent galax-
ies, the current sample of off-nuclear TDEs exhibits
a apparent dichotomy in the detection of local stel-
lar counterparts. Two events, 3XMM J2150−05 and
EP240222a, are associated with clear stellar overdensi-
ties consistent with bound dwarf satellite galaxies, while
AT2024tvd and AT2025abcr, show no detected stellar
counterpart above the ambient halo background. This
dichotomy is quantified by the stellar surface density
contrast at the TDE position, Σ ⋆,local /Σ⋆,halo , measured
from deep pre-TDE imaging (in Appendix C) and re-
ported in the final column of Table 1.
Both 3XMM J2150−05 and EP240222a, showing
Σ⋆,local /Σ⋆,halo >3, quantifying the fact the WBH
remains embedded in a detectable stellar system.
In contrast, both AT2024tvd and AT2025abcr have
no detected overdensity and therefore (by definition)
Σ⋆,local /Σ⋆,halo≡1.
Figure 4 places the observed off-nuclear TDEs in the
context of the stellar overdensity properties of WBHs
predicted byROMULUS. The background points show the
simulated population atz≃0.05, color-coded by halo-
centric distanceR •/R200, while the stars mark the lo-
cations of the four observed events. InROMULUS, the
stellar overdensity associated with each wandering black
hole is defined as the ratio of the stellar mass enclosed
within a fixed physical aperture of 1 kpc centered on the
black hole to the mean stellar density of the host halo
at the same halo-centric radius,ρ ⋆,local /ρ⋆,halo (Ricarte
et al. 2021b). This metric quantifies whether a wan-
dering black hole remains embedded in a bound stellar
system or has been effectively stripped of its extended
stellar envelope.
Our observational measurements necessarily rely on
projected quantities. We therefore characterize the stel-
lar environments of the observed off-nuclear TDEs us-
ing the analogous surface-density ratio Σ ⋆,local /Σ⋆,halo .
While this differs formally from the three-dimensional

Figure 4.Stellar overdensity around wandering black holes as a function of host halo mass. Colored circles show the
ROMULUS(Ricarte et al. 2021b) wandering black hole population atz≃0.05, with color indicating halo-centric radiusR •/R200.
The vertical axis gives the stellar overdensity around the WBHs,ρ ⋆,local /ρ⋆,halo . Stars denote observed off-nuclear TDEs,
for which the analogous projected quantity Σ ⋆,local /Σ⋆,halo is measured. Events associated with surviving dwarf satellites
(3XMM J2150−05 and EP240222a) populate the high-overdensity tail, while events without detected stellar counterparts
(AT2024tvd and AT2025abcr) fall within the dominant population of stripped WBHs. The bimodality between stellar overden-
sity and halo-centric radius seen in the simulation is also reflected in the current off-nuclear TDE sample.
definition used in the simulation, both quantities scale
monotonically with enclosed stellar mass for compact
systems, providing a directly comparable classification
of stellar-embedded versus stripped objects.
A central point illustrated by Fig. 4 is that the physi-
cally relevant quantity governing the stellar environment
of a wandering black hole is the normalized halo-centric
distance,R TDE/R200, rather than the projected offset
on the sky,R TDE,p , even if in physical (kpc) scale. This
dimensionless radius scale with strength of the tidal field
experienced by the system and therefore controls the ef-
ficiency of stellar stripping; it is encoded by the color
scale in the figure. In massive halos, a large projected
separation from the galaxy nucleus does not necessarily
imply a large normalized halo-centric distance.
This is clearly illustrated by comparing
3XMM J2150−05 and AT2025abcr using the values
in Table 1. Despite having comparable projected off-
sets (R TDE,p ≃10 kpc), the two events occupy dif-
ferent positions within their host halos (e.g., see their
diferent colors in Fig. 4). 3XMM J2150−05 lies at
RTDE/R200≃0.05, while AT2025abcr, hosted by a
more massive halo with a larger virial radius (see Table
1), resides deeper in the potential atR TDE/R200≃0.02.
This places the two systems in qualitatively different
tidal regimes, naturally explaining why the former re-
tains a dense stellar counterpart while the latter does
not. In this sense,R TDE,p alone can be misleading, asit does not capture the depth of the system within the
host halo.
Importantly, a stellar overdensity ratio consistent with
unity does not imply that a wandering black hole is
entirely devoid of orbiting stars. Both the simulation
and the observations probe stellar structure on 100’s
pc scales, limited by stellar particle mass resolution
inROMULUSand by surface-brightness sensitivity and
PSF smearing in the imaging data. Compact stellar
systems—such as dense nuclear star clusters originally
associated with the black hole—are more resilient to
tidal stripping (Van Wassenhove et al. 2014; Tremmel
et al. 2018b), yet may remain unresolved or undetectable
at the available resolution. Such components could
nonetheless be sufficiently massive and dense to sustain
a detectable TDE rate, even in the absence of an ex-
tended/detectable stellar counterpart.
As the observed sample grows, we therefore expect
the fraction of events with detectable stellar counter-
parts to remain (in general terms) a bimodal function of
halo-centric radius. Finally, we note that an additional
population of off-nuclear black holes may reside in even
more compact stellar systems, such as globular clus-
ters. While no TDE has yet been securely identified in a
globular cluster, dynamical evidence suggests that some
massive clusters (e.g.,ωCentauri in the Milky Way,
Haberle et al. 2024) likely host IMBHs. Such systems
would fall below the resolution and surface-brightness
limits of both current cosmological simulations and most
9
extragalactic imaging, yet could in principle contribute
to the off-nuclear TDE population.
3.3.Radial Distribution
The final demographic property of the current off-
nuclear TDE sample is the wide range of halo-centric
radii at which these events occur. From the deprojected
offsets listed in Table 1, the four events span nearly
two orders of magnitude in normalized radius, from
RTDE/R200≃0.003 (AT2024tvd) toR TDE/R200≃0.11
(EP240222a).
Figure 5 compares these locations to the radial distri-
bution of wandering black holes predicted byROMULUS.
The blue and teal curves show the simulated halo-centric
distributions, dN/d(R •/R200), atz= 0.05 for halos
with log10(M200/M⊙) = 12.5–13 and 13–13.5, respec-
tively, while the red kernels mark the observed events.
In the simulations, most wandering black holes reside at
0.01≲R •/R200≲0.1, with a declining tail toward both
smaller and larger radii.
The observed off-nuclear TDEs fall within this pre-
dicted range. AT2024tvd, atR TDE/R200≃0.003, lies
near the inner edge of the simulated distribution, where
wandering black holes are rare and typically in the final
stages of orbital decay toward the halo center. Accord-
ingly, the discovery of additional off-nuclear TDEs at
similarly small halo-centric radii to AT2024tvd is ex-
pected to be rare. The remaining events sample the
main body and outer tail of the distribution.
Overall, the radial locations of the current off-nuclear
TDE sample are fully consistent with the expectations
for wandering black holes in massive halos.
4.CONCLUSION
The growing sample of secure off-nuclear TDEs pro-
vides direct empirical evidence for, and a path to the
study of the long-predicted population of off-nuclear
massive black holes (M •≥104M⊙). Despite the small
sample size, these events already exhibit two demo-
graphic patterns: (i) all occur in massive, early-type
galaxies withM ⋆≃1011M⊙; and (ii) events at larger
halo-centric radii are associated with detectable satellite
dwarfs, whereas those deeper in their parent galaxy halo
lack stellar counterpart.
In thisLetterwe showed that both trends can be ex-
tracted from theROMULUSsimulations and are therefore
general expectations of hierarchical galaxy assembly. By
combining the simulation’s WBH occupation statistics
with empirical constraints on the local galaxy popula-
tion, we computed the volumetric WBH density as a
function of parent stellar mass,ϕ WBH(M⋆). This distri-
bution peaks sharply atM ⋆= 1011M⊙and places the

majority of WBHs in the local Universe in parent galax-
ies within the narrow range 10.7≲log10(M⋆/M⊙)≲
11.2, naturally explaining why the entire off-nuclear
TDE sample is located in galaxies with such mass range.
We further showed that the observed presence or ab-
sence of a detectable stellar counterpart follows from
tidal stripping. InROMULUS, WBHs that retain resolved
stellar overdensities (e.g., bound dwarf satellites, as ob-
served for 3XMM J215-05 and EP20240222a) preferen-
tially reside at larger halo-centric radii, while the dom-
inant population at smallerR •/R200has overdensities
near unity, consistent with the non-detection of stellar
counterpart for AT2024tvd and AT2025abcr.
Taken together, these results support a simple in-
terpretation: off-nuclear TDEs are transient accretion
signposts of the WBH population long predicted by
cosmological simulations. As the sample expands with
wide-field time-domain surveys, two clear, testable pre-
dictions follow: parent galaxies should continue to clus-
ter around 10.7≲log10(M⋆/M⊙)≲11.2, and the bi-
modality in the relation between stellar overdensity and
halo-centric radius should, with a few exceptions, per-
sist. The growing sample of off-nuclear TDEs will there-
fore provide increasingly stringent tests of off-nuclear
massive black hole demographics, satellite disruption,
and hierarchical structure formation.

APPENDIX
A.FROMM ⋆ANDR 1/2TOM 200ANDR 200
We estimate the virial mass (M 200) and correspond-
ing virial radius (R 200) of each galaxy from its stellar
mass (M ⋆), projected half-light radius (R 1/2), and red-
shift (z) using a Bayesian framework that combines the
stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) with the empiri-
cal size–halo relation. The SHMR provides a monotonic
mapping between stellar and halo mass, reflecting the
efficiency of baryon conversion into stars across cosmic
time. We adopt the functional form of Moster et al.
(2013), as shown in Equation 2, with an intrinsic scat-
ter ofσ logM ∗= 0.1 dex.
Galaxy size information is incorporated through the
empirical scaling between the half-light radius and halo
radius,R 1/2=fsizeR200, which encapsulates the struc-
tural coupling between galaxies and their host halos.
For early-type (quenched) systems, we adopt a prior
fsize= 0.015 with a lognormal dispersionσ logf =
0.1 dex, consistent with observed size–halo relations for
massive ellipticals (e.g., Kravtsov 2013). BothM 200
andf sizeare treated as free parameters, and their joint
posterior distribution is sampled usingemcee(Foreman-
Mackey et al. 2013).

andH(z) is the Hubble parameter at redshiftz. The
latter is obtained from the cosmological expansion law
in a flat ΛCDM model,H(z) =H 0p
Ωm(1 +z)3+ Ω Λ,
so thatρ c(z) increases with redshift. This evolving crit-
ical density defines the overdensity threshold used to
calculate virial masses and radii.
Overall, this approach combines stellar mass and
galaxy size information to infer self-consistent halo prop-erties while naturally incorporating observational scat-
ter and empirical scaling uncertainties.
B.GALAXY MASSES
We estimate parent-galaxy stellar masses in a homoge-
neous manner using optical photometry from the Legacy
Survey Data Release 10 (Dey et al. 2019), following
the color–dependent mass-to-light ratio prescription of
Baldry et al. (2012). Total galaxy fluxes are measured
from the best-fittingTractorS´ ersic models in theg
andibands.
All photometry is corrected for Galactic extinction
using the dust maps of Schlafly & Finkbeiner (2011)
and the extinction law of Cardelli et al. (1989). Stellar
masses are then computed from the extinction-corrected
i-band luminosity and the rest-frame color (g−i) 0via
log10(M⋆/Li) =a+b(g−i) 0,(B3)
with coefficientsa=−0.68±0.05 andb= 0.73±0.05, as
calibrated by Baldry et al. (2012). Luminosity distances
are calculated assuming a flat ΛCDM cosmology with
H0= 69 km s−1Mpc−1.
Uncertainties onM ⋆include contributions from pho-
tometric errors in thegandiband and the intrinsic
scatter in the mass-to-light ratio calibration. We assume
no internal extinction within the parent galaxies, which
is a reasonable approximation for quenched systems.
By using S´ ersic luminosities, as in Baldry et al. (2012),
we ensure that the effective aperture is not fixed but in-
stead scales with galaxy distance and physical size. This
guarantees that stellar masses are measured consistently
across the sample and can be meaningfully compared.
Importantly, by adopting the exact same methodology
as Baldry et al. (2012), we ensure that our inferred stel-
lar masses are directly comparable to those entering the
galaxy stellar mass function used throughout this work.
C.COMPUTING Σ ⋆,LOCAL /Σ⋆,HALO FOR
3XMM J2150−05 AND EP240222A
To characterize the local stellar environments of the
two off-nuclear TDE associated with dwarf satellites,
EP240222a and 3XMM J2150−05, we compute the ra-
tio between the local and ambient stellar surface densi-
ties, Σ ⋆,local /Σ⋆,halo , using deep optical pre-TDE imag-
ing. For 3XMM J2150−05 we use a 1999HST/WFPC2
image on filter F814W, while for EP240222a use use
Legacy Surveyr−band image from 2014. This quantity
provides a projected, observational analogue to the lo-
11
cal stellar density contrast used in numerical studies of
wandering black holes (e.g., Ricarte et al. 2021b).
For each system, we define a narrow slit connecting
the host galaxy nucleus and the transient position, along
which a one-dimensional flux profile is measured. The
slit defines the radial direction of the galaxy in projec-
tion and serves to locate the transient relative to the
host and to visualize the local environment (upper right
panel in Fig. 6).
The local stellar surface density, Σ ⋆,local , is measured
within a circular aperture (red in Fig. 6) with a ra-
dius that is 3×the image Point Spread Function (PSF),
∼0.15′′HST/WFPC2 and∼1′′for Legacy, centered
on the dwarf position. The ambient halo surface den-
sity, Σ ⋆,halo , is estimated using two rectangular regions
placed perpendicular to the slit direction at the same
projected host-centric radius as the dwarf (yellow in
Fig. 6). These regions sample the surrounding stel-
lar light while excluding the dwarf. Both Σ ⋆,local and
Σ⋆,halo are computed as the mean surface brightness
within their respective regions, minimizing sensitivity
to outliers and small-scale substructure.
We convert the measured surface brightness ratio into
a stellar surface-density ratio by assuming that the stel-
lar mass-to-light ratio is the same in the local and halo
regions. This assumption is reasonable for these sys-
tems, as the off-nuclear transients are associated with
compact dwarf hosts that exhibit old stellar popula-
tions (Lin et al. 2018; Jin et al. 2025). The ratio
Σ⋆,local /Σ⋆,halo is then computed directly from the me-
dian surface densities.
For AT2024tvd and AT2025abcr, no statistically sig-
nificant local overdensity is detected (Yao et al. 2025;
Stein et al. 2026); for these systems we therefore set
Σ⋆,local /Σ⋆,halo = 1 by definition.
